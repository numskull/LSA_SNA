    "### Euclidean Distance\n",
    "Euclidean distances uses a modified form of the Pythagorean theorum to measure how far apart (how similar) terms are in a term-document matrix.  This relies on a conceptual mapping of the terms in a corpus onto vector space so that they have the properties of vectors (direction, magnitude or location) which enables the use of geometric principles to discover underlying linguistic patterns in corpora."

Therefore, Euclidean distances between underrepresented or overrepresented terms can skew the magnitude of the relationships between terms (unrelated terms can be really close together if they're both short vectors)."
