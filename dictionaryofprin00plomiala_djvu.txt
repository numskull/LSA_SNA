INTRODUCTION. 

THREE important events in the history of the book-trade marked the 
period covered by this Dictionary : 

1. The expiration of the Licensing Act of 1662 in 1695. 

2. The paper and pamphlet duties of 1696 and 1713. 

3. The Copyright Act of 1709. 

The result of the first was that during the closing years of the seventeenth 
century printing presses were estabHshed in many provincial towns, Bristol 
and Exeter in the West, Chester, York, Newcastle, and Gateshead in the North, 
Norwich and Ipswich in the East, and with every year their numbers increased 
until by 1725 all the important towns in the kingdom had their own printers. 
Almost the first thing these printers did, was to establish a local newspaper, 
which, though Uttle else than mirrors of the London press, and containing 
scanty local news beyond a few advertisements and the trials of criminals at the 
local assizes, served the useful purpose of broadening the outlook of the people 
and keeping them in touch with the outside world. 

The first of the paper duties was imposed by the 8-9 William III, c. 7, 
called " An Act for granting to his Majesty several duties upon paper, vellum 
and parchment, to encourage the bringing of plate and hammered money into 
the Mints to be coined ". It imposed upon all paper, parchment, and books 
imported an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent., a similar duty of 20 per cent, on 
paper or parchment made, while all stock-in-trade was to pay 17^ per cent. 

In 1711 another Act was passed (10 Anne, c. 18) combining duties on paper 
with a stamp duty on pamphlets and newspapers. The duties on paper took 
the form of a tax per ream which varied in the case of imported paper from 
15. to 165. per ream, and in the case of British-made paper from 4^. to 15. 6d. 
per ream. Books, prints, and maps imported were charged 30 per cent, ad

Settled at Canterbury in 1717, and began by printing a sheet, containing 
the names of the mayor, aldermen and common council, who had encouraged 
the revival of printing in the city. On October 23rd, 17 17, appeared the first 
number of a newspaper called The Kentish Post or, The Canterbury News 
Letter. The early numbers were printed for the proprietors by Thomas 
Reeve, in quarto form with a cover. It was afterwards printed by James 
Abree in partnership with W. Aylett and then by Abree alone, and it then 
took the ordinary form of a small folio, and appeared twice a week. The 
Kentish news in this sheet was confined to a few inches of space on the last 
page, and was of very little interest ; but many Kentish advertisements were 
inserted. In 17 18 Abree printed Thomas Hardres's Panegyrical Poem on the 
Fair and Celebrated Beauties in and about the City of Canterbury, iolio ; in 1 726-7 
several quarto pamphlets in a quarrel between doctors Packe and Grey of

partnership George Kirkby, the son of a Canterbury clergyman, in favour 
of whom he retired in 1768. Kirkby then dropped the pubhcation of the 
Kentish Post, and entered into partnership with another Canterbury printer,

Wottonianae, published by Tooke and Sawbridge. In the same year he pub- 
lished a Latin edition of St. Clement's Epistles to the Corinthians. \T.C. II. 179.]

4 ALLEN— ALLPORT. 

ALLEN, MRS., bookseller in Sevenoaks, 1699. Her name appears in 
the advertisement in the Flying Post, December 2nd, of the publication 
of the Rev. Edward Brown's Sermon preached on the occasion of the Kentish 
Feast on November i6th. It does not appear in the imprint to the Sermon. 

ALLEN, or ALLIN (charles), bookseller in Bristol, Broad Street, 1674-81. 
In 1674 published Bristol Drollery, Poems and Songs by Mr. C, printed in 
London, doubtless by Edward Horton, who entered it in Stat. Reg. [Roxb. il. 
478]. Hazlitt says that the contents have no peculiar connexion with 
Bristol. [Hdbk., p. 169.] In Hilary 1679 he entered in T.C. [l. 342] Short- 
writing, by Laurence Steel of Bristol. His last entry is S. Grossman's Sermons, 
1681. [T.C. I. 438.] 

ALLEN (JOHN), bookseller in London, White Horse, Wentworth Street, near 
Bell Lane, 1669-85. May be the John Allen who was in business in Little 
Britain in 1667 ; but if so there should be more notices of him in the Term 
Catalogues. His imprint is found on a poetical broadside entitled Character 
of London Village, 1684. [b.m. 1872. a. i (28).] 

ALLEN (ROBERT), bookseller in Norwich^ St. Stephen's parish, 1702. Mentioned

ALSOP— ANDERSON. 5 

ALSOP (benjamin), bookseller in London, Angel and Bible over against the 
Stocks Market [in the Poultry], 1679-85. Probably a descendant of Bernard 
Alsop (1616-1653). In 1679 he published John Gerhard's Divine Consolations, 
which was advertised in the Domestic Intelligence of October 21st, In 1681 he 
was defendant in an action for assault brought by Bartholomew Sprint against 
a number of printers and booksellers in London and Oxford, the details of 
which are wanting. [C.P.R. Trinity 33, Charles II, Roll 2992, m. 256.] 
Dunton has this account of him : "He was a first-rate bookseller for some 
years. But see the rambling fate of some men ; for, Ben being a wild sort of 
a Spark, he left his shop to get a commission in Monmouth's army, and, as 
Ben told me in Holland, had the Duke succeeded, he had been made an Earl, 
or a Baron at least : i.e. ' If the sky had fell, he had catched a lark.' I suc- 
ceeded Captain Alsop in hisshop in the Poultry." [Dunton, pp. 147, 214, 262.] 

AMERY (JOHN), bookseller in London, (i) Peacock, Strand, over against St. 
Clement Danes Church ; (2) Peacock, near St. Dunstan's Church, in Fleet- 
street. 1670-86. Dealer in law books. Described by Dunton as " thinking 
Amery." [Dunton, p. 292.] First entry in T.C., Easter 1670. [i. 39.] The 
J. Amery who published the works of Machiavelli in 1695 [T.C. il. 541] may 
have been a son. Amery moved to Fleet Street in 1673. [T.C. 1. 136, 143.] 

ANDERSON (Andrew), printer, 1653-11676. At Edinburgh, 1653-7 ; at 
Glasgow, 1657-61 ; again at Edinburgh, 1661-76. See Dictionary, 1641-67. 

ANDERSON (andrew) and his partners, printers in Edinburgh, 1671-75. This 
is the copartnery of Andrew Anderson with G. Swintoun, J. Glen, T. Brown, 
and D. Trench, in the gift of King's printer, which Anderson obtained in 167 1. 
They printed under the style of " His Majesties Printers" 1672-5, and "Andrew 
Anderson and his partners " 1675. Watson (p. 12) says that on Anderson's 
death (1676), "After printing of one small Bible by the Widow and Partners in 
company, they disagreed ; the booksellers apprehending themselves to be 
wrong'd ... all of them sold of! their shares of the house and gift to 
Mr. Anderson's widow, except George Swinton." [Aldis, p. 107.] 

ANDERSON (heir of Andrew), Edinburgh, 1676-94. 

ANDERSON (heirs of Andrew), 1680-1700. [See Anderson (James). 

ANDERSON (successors of Andrew), 1693-1722. j 



6 ANDERSON— ANDERTON. 

ANDERSON (heirs and successors of Andrew), 1694-17 17. Over against 
the north-side of the Cross ; at the printing House in Edinburgh College, 1693. 
See Anderson (James). 

ANDERSON (james), printer in Edinburgh, i676-(?). After the death of 
Anderson in 1676 his widow {see Anderson, Mrs.) conducted the business in 
conjunction with, or on behalf of, his son and heir James, under the above 
styles. They were printers to the town and college as well as King's printers. 
During the Revolution they dropped the latter title and printed by order of the 
Privy Council until June 1690. Mrs. Anderson came into frequent conflict 
with the other printers and booksellers in her endeavours to enforce the 
monopoly conferred by the gift as King's printer. In 1690 she made an 
unsuccessful attempt, in opposition to Mosman, to obtain the appointment of 
printer to the General Assembly, but in 17 12 succeeded Mosman in his officci 
[Aldis, p. 107.] 

ANDERSON (relict of a.), printer in Edinburgh, 1681. See Anderson, Mrs. 

ANDERSON MRS., printer in Edinburgh, 1676-17 16. See above, Anderson 
(James). Agnes Campbell, wife of A. Anderson. After her husband's death 
in 1676, she conducted the business. By November 1681, she had married 
Patrick Telfair, a merchant in Edinburgh. Died July 24th, 1 7 16. Inventory 
[Bann. Misc. II. 284] names as one of the executors, " Mr. John Campbell, 
corrector of the said defunct her press ". [Aldis, p. 108.] 

ANDERSON (james), stationer in Edinburgh, c. 1679. Will registered July ist, 
1679. [Bann. Misc. II. 296 ; Aldis, p. 108.] 

ANDERTON (william), printer in London, 1688-93. Said to have been a 
North Country man. He was apprenticed to Miles Flesher or Fletcher, and 
later (?) to one Snowden {see below). Became a corrector of the Press. At the 
Revolution he set up a private printing press. At the Sessions of June ist-3rd, 
1693, he was tried for printing two pamphlets. Remarks upon the present con- 
federacy and late Revolution in England and A French Conquest neither 
desirable nor practicable. The principal evidence against him was given by 
Robert Stephens, the Messenger of the Press, who declared he had known the 
prisoner for upward of two years as a printer of seditious libels but never 



ANDREW— ANDREWS. 7 

could tell where he worked. On May 2nd he had tracked two journeymen 
printers to a house and there found William Anderton in a secret room in 
which were a printing press, letters, and all other materials for printing ; 
and in the press was an Errata, as found in the Remarks. Amongst other 
broadsides found in the room were : A Caution to the Navy, An Historical 
Romance upon the Wars, A Second Letter to the Bishop of Salisbury, which were 
said to be in the same type as the Remarks. Two printers, R. Roberts and one 
Snowden, a dissenter to whom Anderton was some time an apprentice, also 
gave evidence. In summing up the evidence everything was aggravated to the 
utmost, but it was a long time before the jury could be persuaded to find him 
guilty of high treason. He was sentenced to death and executed at Tyburn on 
June 1 6th, 1693. [Proceedings on the King and Queen's Commissions of 
the Peace, B.M. 515. 1. 2 (149). — An account of the Conversation, Behaviour and 
Execution of William Anderton, printer, B.M. 515. 1. 2 (150). — HmveU's State 
Trials, xii. 1240-67.] 

ANDREW (JOHN), bookseller in Glasgow, 1676. Named among the debtors in 
Andrew Anderson's inventory (1676). The " John Androw, in Glasgow ", men- 
tioned in G. Lithgow's inventory (1662) may be the same. The will of Bessie 
Sheills, his widow, was registered December 27th, 1689. [Aldis, p. 108.] 

ANDREWE (RICHARD), stationer of London, 1683. Only known from his will, 
which was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on September nth, 
1683. As he left bequests to the towns of Desborow and Thorpe in North- 
amptonshire, he was perhaps a native of that county. He also referred to his 
son-in-law John Bird, who may be the bookseller of that name who is found 
renting a stall in Westminster Hall in 1689. [P.C.C. loi, Drax.] 

ANDREWS (ROBERT), type-founder in London, Charterhouse Street, 1680-1735. 
Bom in 1650. He served as Steward of the 69th Feast of the Masters and 
Workmen printers in 1680 and about 1683 succeeded to the foundry of 
Joseph Moxon, which he transferred to Charterhouse Street. His foundry, 
largely consisting of Moxon's matrices, was, next to Grover's, the most 
extensive of his day, and consisted of a large variety of Roman letters and 
titlings, 1 1 Hebrew and 5 Rabbinical founts, &c. He was Junior Warden of the 
Company of Stationers in 1702-3 and 1703-4, and Senior Warden in 1706-7 
and 1707-8. Although he accumulated a large quantity of matrices, Andrews 



8 ANDREWS— ASPERNE. 

does not appear to have been a good workman. Humphrey Wanley describes 
him as a " blunderer" because he cut the punches for Elizabeth Elstob's Saxon 
Grammar so badly. According to Timperley Andrews died November 27th, 
1735, aged 80, but if that were so, it would make his age 85. His son Silvester 
carried on the business at Oxford. Thomas James subsequently purchased 
both foundries. [Reed, pp. 194-7 ; Timperley, p. 653.] 

APPLEBEE (JOHN), printer and bookseller in London, (a) a little below Bridewell 
Bridge in Black-Fryers; (b) Fleet Ditch. 17 15-1724. Printer of pamphlets 
and broadsides. In 17 15 he printed the St. James's Evening Post, or Nightly 
Pacquet, " for Samuel Jackson, over against Bridewell-Bridge ". He was also 
the printer of a Daily Journal and a Weekly Journal bearing his own name. 
[Timperley, p. 632.] His printing was very bad, and his type worn and old. 

APPLEBY, MRS., bookseller at Gravesend, 17 11. Only known from an 
advertisement of Seanians Speculum or complete schoolmaster, by John Davis, 
in the Post Man, March loth, 17^1. 

ARCHER (JOSEPH), bookseller in London, near the Playhouse in Great Russell 
Street, Covent Garden, 1 7 1 1 . His name occurs in an advertisement of a sale of 
miscellaneous books by Sam. lUidge in the Daily Courant of January 19th, 
1711 ; and in the following month he was mentioned as one of the booksellers 
receiving subscriptions for R. Bradley's Treatise of succulent plants, adver- 
tised in the Post Man of February 3rd. 

ARCHER (THOMAS), bookseller in London, Fleet Street, under St. Dunstan's 
Church, 167 1-3. In partnership with Thomas Burrell he issued in 167 1 
E. Maynwaring's Praxis Medicorum [T.C. I. 71], and in 1672 was one of the 
publishers of the second edition of P. Heyljm's Aerius Redivivus, or, the 
History of the Presbyterians. His last entry was, in Trinity, 1673, A Pleasant 
Treatise of Witches. [T.C. I. 142 ; Haz. ii. 654.] 

ASHBURN (ROBERT), bookseller in York, 1676. Sold The [or An] Appeal 
from the Cabal, 1676. 

ASHWORTH ( ), bookseller in Durham, 1696. Only known from an 
advertisement of patent medicines in the London Gazette, February 25th, 169! . 

ASPERNE (jO.), bookseller in London, c. 1700. Only known from the 
imprint to a broadside entitled Duke of Shoreditch ; or Barlow's Ghost, 
London, Printed for J. Aspeme [c. 1700]. [Haz. 11. 365.] 



ASTLEY— ATKINS. 9 

ASTLEY (THOMAS), bookseller in London, Saint Paul's Churchyard, 1729. 
Publisher of the London Magazine. [Timperley, p. 657.] 

ASTWOOD (jAMES), printer in London. Behind St. Christopher's Church in 
Threadneedle Street, the back-side of the Royal Exchange, 1691-1705. 
Dunton writes, " He was my near Neighbour and intimate Friend for many 
years . He printed for me near Sixty books, and was constantly engaged in the 
* Athenian Mercury '. . . . Since the death of his son (Mr. John Astwood) he 
seems no longer to have any commerce with the world and hath nothing so 
familiar as a life that is (by his retreat from London to a country village) as it 
were buried in death." [Dunton, p. 245.] As Dunton speaks of him as a 
" near neighbour " his printing house was probably that in which his son

printed was John Lawrence the bookseller. His address is given in full in an 
advertisement in the Post Boy of May loth, 1698. 

ATHERTON ( ), bookseller in London, c. 1700. Dunton [p. 292] mentions,

his name disappears from the Term Catalogues until 1707, when he is found 
at the Golden Ball in St. Paul's Churchyard in partnership with M. New- 
borough, publishing Boyer's Wise and ingenious Companion, French and 
English and several other works. He was still in business in 17 15, when he 
issued the first edition of Ralph Thoresby's Ducatus.

Holiday Yard in Creed Lane, near Ludgate Street, 1692 ; (2) Blue Ball in 
Duck Lane, 1696. 1692-1703. Dunton [p. 258] describes him as a man " of 
a great deal of wit and honesty. ... He was my chief binder for ten years ; 
but honest Tom has met with losses . . . but, notwithstanding ... I believe 
Mr. Axe will get money enough : for he is not only a good binder, but sells 
Books, Globes, Auctions ". In 1692 he published an Epitome of the Whole Art 
of War. [r.C.II.394.] His last entry was in Trinity 1696 : Letters and Essays on 
several subjects . . . in Prose and Verse to John Dryden Esq. . . . Mr. Congreve

AYLMER (brabazon) sen. and jun., booksellers in London, Three Pigeons over 
against (or near) the Royal Exchange, 1670-1709. Dealers in theological works. 
In the Term Catalogue of Hilary 1670 Aylmer sen. advertised a small school- 
book called Formulae Oratoriae, but without giving any address. [T.C. i. 27.] 
His first entry in the Stationers' Register was made on December 12th, 1673, 
when in partnership with Nath. Ranew and Jonathan Robinson he entered 
Dr. Bates's Harmony of the Divine Attributes [Stat. Reg., Roxb., vol. 11, p. 474], 
and in 16^4 Joannis Miltoni Angli Epistolarum familiarium liber unus [ibid., 
p. 481]. He became the assignee of Samuel Simmons and so held the 
copyright of Paradise Lost, one half of which he sold to Jacob Tonson on 
August 17th, 1683, and the other on March 24th, 1690. [Masson, Life of 
Milton, VI. 786,] Dunton [p. 206] speaks of him as " a very just and religious 
man. I was partner with him in Keith's Narrative of the proceedings at 
Turner^ s Hall, and so had an opportunity to know him. He is nicely exact in 
all his accounts and is well acquainted with the mysteries of his trade." In 
1707 the names of Brabazon Aylmer sen. and jun. are found together in 
several entries in the Term Catalogues. [T.C. iii. 533-54.] The few subsequent 
entries in 1708 and 1709 of plain Brabazon Aylmer, at the same address, 
may imply that the father was dead and the son carrying on the business. 

AYSCOUGH (WILLIAM), printer in Nottingham, Bridlesmith Gate, 1710-19. 
In 17 10 he printed for Hildyard of York and Ryles of Hull Remarks on the

several paragraphs of the Bishop of Salisbury's speech in relation to the first 
article of Dr. Sacheverell's impeachment [bm. hi. b. 28]. The second edition 
of Sir T. Parkyn's Inn-Play, 1714 (also perhaps the first, 1713), was printed for 
him and for Timothy Goodwin of London. In 17 17 he printed the Grammatical 
Commentaries, by R. Johnson, Head Master of the Free School in Nottingham ; 
and in 1718-19, for Mrs. Hartshorn at Leicester, The Certainty . . . of a future 
General Judgement. A sermon preached at Leicester . . . Mar. igth, ijiS-i^, 
n. d. Deering in his Nottinghamia Vetus et Nova, 1751, 4*°, Sec. 2, p. 40, records 
the following inscription in St. Peter's Church, in the South aisle : " Here 
lye the bodies of William Ayscough, Printer and Bookseller of this Town ; 
and Anne his wife, she was daughter of the Rev. Mr. Young, Rector of 
Catwick in the County of York. He died March 2, 1719 : she died Dec. 16,

on May 3rd, 1675, ^^^ seven years to Thomas Passenger {q. v. Diet, 1641-67). 



BADMAN— BAGFORD. 13 

On taking up his freedom Back set up for himself at the sign of the Black 
Boy, and, like other London Bridge booksellers, dealt chiefly in cheap 
popular literature, ballads, broadsides, chap-books and school-books. About 
1696 he was appointed bookseller to the Society of Kentish Men, and in 
addition to selling tickets for the Annual Feast he published the sermons 
preached at it from 1697 to 1701. He died in the end of June 1703, and 
was buried in St. Magnus Church on July 3rd [Churchwardens' Accounts of 
St. Magnus.] 

BADMAN (C), see Bateman. 

BAGFORD (john), bookseller and printer in London, 1650-1716. Thomas 
Hearne, the antiquary, believed John Bagford to have been bom in Fetter 
Lane ; but other authorities state his birthplace to have been in the parish of 
St. Anne's, Blackfriars. It is probable that he was originally a shoemaker by 
trade, but afterwards became a collector of books on commission for booksellers 
and amateurs, more especially for Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, Sir Hans 
Sloane, and John Moore, Bishop of Ely. He was also a bookseller, and during 
the great frost of January 1716 he had a printing press at work on the Thames. 
Bagford collected an immense amount of material, both manuscript and 
printed, for a history of printing, which was also to include bookbinding and 
paper-making ; but it was never published. As a bookseller, he was fre- 
quently asked to make up imperfect books, and it was the custom of the book 
trade to collect title-pages and portions of books for this purpose. A great 
number of Bagford's title-pages and fragments are from books which could 
have been bought in his days for a few pence, while it is highly probable that 
some of them were salvage from the Great Fire of 1666, when immense 
quantities of books were burnt or damaged ; that Bagford wilfully destroyed 
books, in order to form his collections, is a slander on a man who was 
universally spoken of as " honest John Bagford " and who, according to 
Thomas Hearne, was a " despiser of Money ". In fact, many of these title- 
pages show the source from which they were obtained, as they bear the name 
of the person from whom he received them. Without his industry, many 
books and editions of books would have perished entirely, being only known 
to us from the title-page in the Bagford collection. This collection comprises 
129 volumes, including three of ballads. The manuscript pieces are contained 
in 36 volumes, the printed pieces in 63. In addition to title-pages this collection 



14 BAGFORD— BAKER. 

contains much miscellaneous matter of interest, such as printers* devices, 
advertisements, and book-plates. In his old age Bagford was admitted to the 
Charterhouse, and on his death on May 5th, 17 16, was buried in the 
Charterhouse graveyard. [Bibl. Soc. Trans., iv. 185-201 ; vii. 123-160.] 

BAGNALL (john), printer in London, near Fleet Street, 1709, and at Ipswich, 
1717-35. The only thing known from his London press is Sir John Packing- 
ton's speech in the House of Commons relating to the Harbour of Dunkirk. 
[Bibl. Lind. Broadsides no. 966.] For his Ipswich press see Allnutt, p. 301. 

BAILEY, or BAYLY (john), bookseller in London, Judge's Head, Chancery 
Lane, near Fleet Street, 1708-9. At the latter end of 1708 or the beginning 
of 1709 he pubHshed A Complete Course of Chemistry by George Wilson. 
[T.C. III. 629.] Possibly Dunton's " Grammatical Bayley " [p. 293]. 

BAILEY (william), bookseller at Burton on Trent, Lichfield, Tamworth, and 
Wolverhampton, 1685. His name appears in a list of booksellers selling a 
patent medicine, given at the end of M. Bromfield's Brief discovery of the . . . 
Scurvy, 1685. [N. di'Q., 11 Ser., xi. 45.] 

BAKER ( ), bookbinder in London, Warwick Lane, c. 1703. Bound for 
Dunton, who speaks [p. 258] of the excellence of his work. 

BAKER (g.), bookseller (?) in London, Bridge Row, north-east corner of the 
Royal Exchange, 1679. In this year he published a map of the world by 
Francis Lamb. [2\C. i. 364, 372.] 

BAKER (j.), bookseller in London, Black Boy, Paternoster Row, 1680-17 10. 
In the Post Man for January 13th, 1680, he advertised The Political State of 
Great Britain, but advertised nothing in the Term Catalogues until 1709, 
when he entered A Vindication of the Church and Clergy of England from some 
late Reproaches. He dealt chiefly in theology. A J. Baker was senior warden 
of the Company of Stationers in 1686-7. 

BAKER (john), bookseller in London, (i) at ]\Iercers' Chapel [i.e. in 
Mercers' Chapel Porch] at the lower end of Cheapside, 1703-25 ; (2) Sun and 
Moon, Comhill, 1707 ; (3) near the Bank, in the Poultry, 1709. There 
was more than one bookseller of this name in London at the beginning of the 
eighteenth century, and it is possible that the addresses given above are those 
of two or perhaps three distinct men. First we find a John Baker issuing in 



BAKER— BALDWIN. 15 

1703 a devotional book from Mercers' Chapel, and Dunton [p. 226] refers to 
him as at this address. [T.C. in. 366.] Then a gap of five years occurs 
during which no book was entered in the Term Catalogue by J. Baker 
of Mercers' Chapel, but in July 1707 several books of importance were 
issued by J. Baker in partnership with R. Burrough at the Sun and 
Moon [T.C. III. 556-8.] Then at the latter end of 1708 or the beginning of 
1709 J. Baker of Mercers' Chapel begins advertising again in the Term 
Catalogue [T.C. ill. 606]. In 17 11 he issued A Full Account of the Rise . . . 
oj Dr. Ashetoti's proposal, as managed by the Worshipful Company of Mercers, 
London, for the benefit of Widows. In 1722 he started Baker's News, or, tlie 
Whitehall Journal, " to be continued weekly ", the first number of which was 
dated May 24th. 

BAKER (s.), bookseller in London, 1717. Publisher of J. Arbuthnot's Present 
State of the Crown-Inn (2 edd.), 1717. [Esdaile, p. 154.] 

BAKER (thomas), bookseller in London, Bible and Rose, Ludgate Street, near 
the West end of St. Paul's, 1708-9. Publisher of theological books and works 
on book-keeping. [T.C. in. 594, 609, 625, 639.] 

BAKEWELL (thomas), map- and print-seller in London, next the Horn Tavern 
in Fleet Street, 1670. Publisher of John Ogilby's England Exactly Described 
. . . Ina compleat Sett of . . . Mapps. [Haz. 111. 179.] 

BALDWIN (ann), bookseller in London, Oxford Arms, Warwick Lane, 1698- 
171 1. Widow of Richard Baldwin. Dunton [p. 260] writes of her : " Mrs. A. 
Baldwin, in a literal sense was an help-meet and eased him of all his publishing 
work ; and since she has been a widow, might vie with all the women in 
Europe for accuracy and justice in keeping accompts. . . .' 

BALDWIN (RICHARD), bookseller, bookbinder and printer in London, (i) In 
BaU Court, near the Black Bull, Great Old Bailey ; (2) Oxford Arms, Warwick 
Lane. 1681-98. One of the best-known publishers of his day, his publications 
consisting largely of political pamphlets and broadsides, satires on social 
life and on current literature, as well as plays and romances. The news- 
papers of the last twenty years of the seventeenth century are full of his 
advertisements and it is surprising that no biography of him exists. Dunton 
says that Baldwin was a native of Wickham ; but there is more than one 
Wickham in England, and Dunton does not specify the county. Nothing is 



i6 BALDWIN. 

known as to his parentage, his apprenticeship, or his commencement in 
business. His name is first met with in the Term Catalogue for Hilary Term 
1681, when he advertised a political pamphlet of twenty folio pages entitled 
The Certain Way to save England. [T.C. i. 429.] At this time he was also 
carrying on the business of a bookbinder in Ball Court, near the Black Bull 
in the Old Bailey, and numbered John Dunton among his customers. In the 
same year he published a newspaper called Mercurius Anglicus, previously 
printed by Robert Harford. [Timperley, p. 558.] He was also erroneously 
believed to have been the printer and publisher of the first and second parts 
of a notorious pamphlet, No Protestant Plot. In Michaelmas Term he 
brought an action in the Court of Common Pleas against Thomas Newcombe, 
John Towse, Randall Taylor, and Michael Foster, three of whom were 
stationers, for assault ; but the particulars are wanting. [C.P.R. 2996, m, 256 
recto.] In The Impartial Protestant Mercury of January loth, i68|, is an 
account of an assault made on two of Baldwin's apprentices, which incidentally 
records that it was a long-established custom for bookbinders' servants on 
Saturday nights to post up the titles of such books as their masters had 
to bind which were to be published the following week. The title which 
led to the trouble was a political one, Rights of the Kingdom, or Customs of our 
Ancestors, the result being that one of the lads was forced to give security and 
a copy of the book was sent to one of the Secretaries of State. On May ist 
Baldwin began to issue another newspaper called The Protestant Courant, 
and a complaint was lodged with the Judges of the King's Bench that it 
reflected upon the Government ; but there is no record of what followed. 
[London Mercury, May 15-18, 1682 ; Timperley, p. 563.] In 1691 he was 
summoned before the House of Commons for printing and being the author 
of Tlie New Observator, but made his peace by declaring that Dr. Wellwood was 
the author of the paper. [C. J. X. 558, 562, 566]. During the year 1695 ^^ 
published a paper called The Post-Man, which drew a protest from the editor 
of The Post-Boy, who declared that the author of The Post-Man was Monsieur 
de Fonvive. {Post-Boy, Oct. 26-9, 1695]. I" 1^97 ^^ was sued by the King's 
Printers for printing speeches. Baldwin continued to publish The Post-Man 
until his death in 169I. Space forbids notice of the many satires published 
by Baldwin, but Dunton has the following notice of him : "He printed a 
great deal, but got as little by it as John Dunton. He bound for me and 
others when he lived in the Old Bailey ; but, removing to Warwick Lane, 



BALDWIN— BALLARD. 17 

his fame for publishing spread so fast, he grew too big to handle his small 
tools. Mr. Baldwin having got acquaintance with Persons of Quality, he 
was now for taking a shop in Fleet street ; but Dick, soaring out of his 
element, had the honour of being a Bookseller but a few months. However 
to do Mr. Baldwin justice, his inclinations were to oblige all men, and only to 
neglect himself. He was a man of a generous temper. . . . His purse and his 
heart were open to all men that he thought were honest ; and his conversation 
was very diverting. He was a true lover of King William ; and, after he came 
on the Livery, always voted on the right side. ... He was as it were flattered 
into his grave by a long consumption ; and now Hes buried in Wickham 
parish his native place. " 

BALDWIN (t.), a misprint for T. Bassett {q. v.), in The honesty and true 
zeal of the King*s witnesses justified by Florence Weyer, Gent., 1681. [Haz. il. 
637 ; B.M. T. 2* (14). See T.C. i. 465, which gives Bassett's name.] 

BALL ( ), printer in London, Fetter Lane, 1709. Referred to by J. How as 
a pirate printer. [Some Thoughts on the present state of Printing and Book- 
selling, 1709, p. 12.] 

BALL (JOHN), stationer in Banbury, against the Shambles, 1685. Occurs in 
a list of booksellers and stationers who sold a patent medicine, given at the 
end of M. Bromfield's A brief discovery of the . . . scurvy. [N. &Q.11 Ser., XI, 
45-] 

BALLARD (j.), a misprint for S. Ballard (q.v.) in one of the editions of 
The Clergyman's Vade Mecum. 

BALLARD (samuel), bookseller in London, Blue Ball in Little Britain, 1706- 
33. Issued in 1706 an edition of The History of George a Green [b.M. 1077. 
e. 32.], and also The Clergytnan's Vade Mecum. [T.C. III. 494.] He was 
probably related to Thomas Ballard, who was carrying on business in the same 
street. Samuel was still in business in 1733. 

BALLARD (thomas), bookseller and book auctioneer in London, (i) Ring in 
Little Britain ; (2) Rising Sun in Little Britain. 1698-1725. Believed to 
have been the first of an eminent firm of booksellers. He is first found associated 
with and sharing the premises of G. Conyers at the Ring in Little Britain in 
1698, and his first advertised publication was Youth's Safety, or Advice to the 

c 



i8 BALLARD— BANKS. 

Younger Sort. [T.C. in. 8i.] In 1700 he moved to the " Rising Sun ", and 
Dunton [p. 222] briefly notices him as " a young bookseller in Little Britain ; 
but is grown man in body now but more in mind ". Soon after this he appears 
to have added to his business as a bookseller that of a book auctioneer. 
In the Daily Courant of January 2nd, 1711, he advertised for sale the libraries 
of Sir Thomas Browne and his son Dr. Edward Browne. Amongst other 
collections dispersed by him were that of Dr. William Salmon, 17 13-14, and 
the smaller library of Dr. Charles Oliphant, 1720. In March 17!^ he 
issued a catalogue of miscellaneous books. He was succeeded in business by 
Edward Ballard. 

BALLINGER (john), bookseller in Cirencester, 1723-42. Noticed by 
H. Norris in his Notes on Booksellers of Cirencester. [N. & Q.,ii Ser., ii. 141.] 

BANBURY (bennet), bookseller in London, Blue Anchor in the New Exchange, 
1700. His name occurs in the imprint to Mrs. Centlivre's play, The Perjured 
Husband, 1700. [b.M. 644. g. 27.] 

BANKS (a.), printer in Edinburgh, 1706. Printed in 1706 a broadside entitled 
A List of the Nobility and Gentry . . . for and against the Union, [b.m. Harl. 
5938 (90).] 

BANKS (ALEXANDER), bookseller in London, Charing Cross, 1676-85. In an 
inquiry by a Committee of the House of Lords, February 19th, 167-I, 
into the publication of certain libellous pamphlets, it was incidentally 
stated that Alexander Banks was one of the compositors of Nathaniel 
Thompson, one of the printers involved. [Hist. MSS. Comm., 9th Report, 
App.] Banks subsequently became a publisher of ballads and broadsides. 
At the time of the Oates conspiracy in 1681, he published The Hue and Cry 
after Dr. T. Oates, and in 1684 he issued a broadside by Thomas Calvert, 
entitled A Letter from the Chancellour of Maryland to Col. Henry Meese, 
concerning the late troubles in Maryland. His name does not appear in the 
Term Catalogues. 

BANKS (ALLEN), bookseller in London, (i) Flower de Luce, next door to the 
Three Squirrels, Fleet Street, over against St. Dunstan's Church, 1668-71 ; 
(2) St. Peter's Head, West End of St. Pauls, 1672 ; (3) St. Peters Head, 
Whitefriars, 1673 5 (4) Fetter Lane, 1673-82. 1668-82. In i668 Charles 
Harper and Allen Banks entered in the Stationers' Registers as their joint 



BANKS— BARBER. 19 

copyright Lukin's Introduction to the Holy Scriptures [Trans. Roxb. 11. 386], 
and in the same year they published the English version of Louis Fontaine's 
satire, A Relation of the Country of lansenia. [b.m. 873. f. 7.] It is not until 
1670 that his name appears in the Term Catalogues, and his last advertisement 
in that publication is in February, 1674. {T.C. I. 163.] In 1672 he dissolved 
partnership with Harper and set up for himself at the sign of St. Peter's Head 
in the Churchyard ; but in the following year he carried the sign into White- 
friars. On March 13th, 1680, he issued a news sheet called Currant Intelligence. 
There was already one publication with this title, and its publisher, John Smith, 
■ in his issue of April 6th, 1680, issued a warning to his readers : *' This Intelli- 
gence having gained reputation as well by its truth as honesty, some persons 
have maliciously printed another with the very same title . . therefore we 
think fit to give notice, that the counterfeit ' Currant Intelligence ' is printed 
for Allen Banks in Fetter Lane, but the true one for John Smith in Great 
Queen Street." Banks's news sheet was very short lived ; four numbers can 
be traced ; but he continued pubUshing up to 1682, when he issued the works

with the ' Faithful Bancks ', mentioned by Dunton. [p. 292.] 

BANKS (HAMMOND), bookseller in London, 1714. Married Anne Rogers, sister 
of William Rogers of Clifford's Inn, London, Gent., and is mentioned in his

BARBER (JOHN), printer in London, (i) Queen's Head Alley ; (2) Lambeth 
Hill. 1700-40. Bom in 1675 o^ P^o^ parents, Dunton says [pp. 248, 250] 
that he was apprenticed to the elder Larkin and afterwards successfully 
managed the printing office of Henry Clark's widow. He set up for himself 
in Queen's Head Alley in 1700. Dean Swift befriended him in many ways and 
makes frequent reference to him in his Letters to Stella. It was probably 
through Swift's influence that Barber was engaged as printer to the ministry 
of the day, and he printed for Pope, Prior, Dr. King, and Mrs. Manley. Through

the patronage of Bolingbroke he obtained the contract for printing the votes 
of the House of Commons, and became printer of the London Gazette, the 
Examiner and Mercator. He was also printer to the City of London, and 
received the reversion of the Royal Printing House after Baskett, but 
relinquished the latter post for a sum of £1,500. Elected an alderman of 
Baynard Castle Ward, Barber filled the office of Sheriff, and in 1733 became 
Lord Mayor. At the time of the South Sea scheme. Barber took large shares

BARKER (CHRISTOPHER) the Third, see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

BARKSDALE (jOHN), bookseller and bookbinder in London and Cirencester, 
London : At (or over against) the Five Bells, New Street ; between Fetter 
Lane and Shoe Lane. 1674-17 19. Related in some way to Clement Barks- 
dale, the Gloucestershire author. He is first mentioned in the Term Catalogues 
for Hilary 1674 as the publisher of a translation of Procopius. [T.C. I. 177.] 
Between 1675 and 1678 he published several of Clement Barksdale's transla- 
tions from Hugo Grotius. Some time between this and 1680 he appears to 
have moved to Cirencester and set up as a bookseller, publishing in the latter 
year T. Beye's Epitaphia, and in 1681 Memorials of Alderman Whitmore, Bishop 
Wilkins di-c, and there appear to be two impressions of the latter, unless 
the edition was divided in half, one bearing the imprint of the London 
publisher, Sam. Lee, at the Feathers in Lumbard Street, 1681, and the other

that of John Barksdale, bookseller in Cirencester, 1681. [Haz. 11. 37.] Barks- 
dale was still there in 1698, when he published The Minister of Cirencester's 
Address to the Dissenters of his Parish, [b.m. T. 1047 (13).] There is no 
evidence to connect him with the John Barksdale, Gentleman, of Middleton- 
Cheny in Northampton, who died in 1699 and whose funeral sermon was 
preached by the Rev. Thomas Hilton. [b.m. 4903. ee. 28.] Mr. Herbert Norris,

January loth l^\^. [N. 6* Q., 11 Ser., xi. 141.] 

BARNARD (henry), bookseller in London, the Bible in the Poultry, 1693. 
There is no mention of this bookseller either in the Term Catalogues, in

Gift for Dr. Birch, [b.m. T. 1047 (10).] In 1697 a small tract entitled Fasti 
Gulielmi Tertii was issued by him, and he was still in business in 17 11.

22 BARTLET— BASKETT. 

BARTLET (ROGER), bookbinder in Oxford, 1674-82. In Anthony a Wood's 
Diary occurs the following : " Dec. 24, 1674, Th[ursday], to Bartlet, 45. for 
binding 7 paper books with stained covers : to Mr. Bartlett for binding my 
book [i. e. Hist, et Antiq. Oxon] 75. 6d. a piece 3 in number." [Wood, li. 299.] 
In a book belonging to Anthony a Wood is a note : " 7 Apr. 1681 to Roger 
Bartlet of Oxon for binding of this book 6d." followed by the bookbinder's 
signature, " Rog. Bartlet ", in evidence of receipt. [7^. I. 249.] He was 
possibly a relative of T. Bartlett {q. v.) 

BARTLETT (thomas), bookseller at Oxford, 1677. Advertised in 1677 
A Philosophical Essay towards an Eviction of the Being and Attributes of God, 
by Seth [Ward], Lord Bishop of Salisbury. [T.C. i. 277.] Possibly a relative

BARTON (george), bookseller in Boston, Lincolnshire, 17 10. Sold E. Kelsall's 
Mistakes about moderation detected, London, 17 10. [b.m. 225. h. 12 (2).] 

BARTON (HUMPHRY), see Burton. 

BASKERVILLE (anthony), bookseller in London, the Bible, against 
St. Clement's Church, 1688-9. His name occurs in the imprint to the Latin 
edition of Joseph Glanville's Saducismus Triumphatus, 1689. Mr. Hilton- 
Price, in his Signs of the old Houses in the Strand, notices him as being there 
in 1688. [Middx. 6° Hert. N. 6° Q., II. 95.] There is no trace of him in the 
Stationers' Register, or in the Term Catalogues. 

BASKERVILLE (laurence), bookseller in London, at the Red Lion in Alder- 
manbury, 1688. He and John Marsh sold The British Language in its Lustre, 
or a copious Dictionary of Welsh and English, by Thomas Jones, 1688, 8^'*. 
[Haz. I. 240,] 

BASKETT (JOHN), King's printer, London, Blackfriars, Oxford and Edinburgh, 
1709-42. Nothing seems to be certainly known of Baskett's antecedents. 
He is first heard of as purchasing the patent of King's printer for Bible 
printing from the executors of Thomas Newcombe and Henry Hills in 1709, 
and his name first appeared on a New Testament ini7i2. Ini7i3he began 
to print the Book of Common Prayer. Four editions of the Bible appeared 
with his imprint in 17 15. His next publication was an edition in two volumes 
imperial foHo printed at Oxford (the Old Testament in 17 17 and New Testa- 
ment in 17 16). Dibdin called this the most magnificent of the Oxford Bibles ;

it has also been called " A Baskett-full of Printers errors " ; but of its typo- 
graphical beauty there could be no two opinions. In 1718 Baskett mortgaged 
his printing materials to James Brooks, stationer, of London. It included 
" A very large fount of Double Pica, new, the largest in England ". It seems 
possible that this was cut by Caslon I. In 1711 Baskett acquired a third part 
of Robert Freebaim's gift as King's printer in Scotland, and in 17 16 he 
obtained, in conjunction with the widow of Andrew Anderson, a fresh com- 
mission as King's printers in Scotland. Baskett appears to have allowed his 
share of these privileges to lie dormant until 1725, when he set up a printing- 
house in Edinburgh and produced some indifferent editions of the Bible 
during the next three or four years. [Lee (John), Memorial Jot the Bible 
Societies in Scotland, Edinburgh, 1824 (pp. 179-83 and App. xxxi) ; 
Additional Memorial, 1826 (p. 153).] Baskett was frequently called upon to 
defend his title of King's printer in the courts of law, especially in Scotland, 
where it was stubbornly disputed by John Watson, a printer, and finally 
settled by a judgement of Lord Mansfield in favour of Baskett. At Cambridge 
he was seriously disturbed by the proposal of W. Ged to stereotype Bibles and 
Prayer-books, and succeeded by intrigues in damaging the success of Ged*s 
innovation. In the year 1737 Baskett's printing office was burnt. He died on 
June 22nd, 1742. He left three sons, Thomas, Robert, and John. His will 
was proved on the 23rd. Baskett desired that his body might be buried in 
St. Ann's, Blackfriars. To his son Thomas he left " the messuage or late 
dwelling house, lately rebuilt, adjoining to the King's Printing House in 
Blackfryers, the courtyard and other appurtenances . . . also all that other 
piece of ground whereon part of my dwelling house stood before the fire in 
January 1737 and whereon part of the printing house now stands ". To his son 
John he left an annuity of £200. " To each of the compositors and pressmen 
which shall be at work in my printing house at the time of my death, ten 
shillings, and to each of the boys, five shillings." He directed that his 
patents were not to be sold but to remain in the family, " during the remainder 
of the several terms of years therein yet to come." His daughter Elizabeth 
married — Innys. [P.C.C. 176, Tremley.] Baskett was Master of the 
Stationers' Company in 1714 and 1715. 

BASSET (j.), bookseller in London (?), 1693. Published an edition of the 
Counter-Scuffle, 1693. [Haz. 11. 529.] 



84 BASSET— BATEMAN. 

BASSET (RICHARD), bookseller in London, (i) Mitre, Fleet Street, (a) near the 
Inner Temple Gate, (b) over against Chancery Lane, (c) within Temple Bar ; 
(2) George, Fleet Street, over against Inner Temple Lane. 1697-1706. 
Dealer in all kinds of literature and publisher of plays and poems. In most 
of his publications his name appears jointly with that of Abel Roper, from 
which it may be inferred that there was some kind of partnership between 
them. His first and last entries in the Term Catalogues were in Michaelmas 
1697 and Trinity 1706. [T.C. ill. 40, 512.] 

BASSET (THOMAS), see Dictionary, 1641-67 ; also Baldwin (T.) 

BATEMAN (Christopher), bookseller and book-auctioneer in London, (i) 
Bible and Crown, Middle Row, Holbom ; (2) Bible and Crown, Paternoster 
Row, Comer shop. 1698-1730. Probably no bookseller's shop in London was 
better known in the days of Swift and his contemporaries. Bateman had a 
large stock of new and second-hand books. He was in addition a book 
auctioneer of some repute, and the pubhsher of one or two notable works. 
He is first heard of as an auctioneer. In or about 1686 he sold a stock of 
philological and Greek books, and on February 18th, 1698, " the Mathematical 
and Physical parts of the famous library of Sir Charles Scarburgh, Kt., M.D." 
[Lawler, p. 183 ; b.m. 831. i. 5 (9).] Dunton says of him [p. 217] : " There 
are very few booksellers in England (if any) that understand books better 
than Mr. Bateman, nor does his diligence and industry come short of his know- 
ledge. He is a man of great reputation and honesty, and is the son of that 
famous Bateman, who got an alderman's estate by bookselhng." We have not 
been able to identify the father. The aldermen of the name were not booksellers. 
[Beaven, The Aldermen of the City of London.] But possibly " an alderman's 
estate " is a figurative phrase. Stephen or W. Bateman might be the man, for 
if they published little, they may have been large retail dealers. Christopher 
Bateman makes his first appearance as a publisher in Easter Term 1699, 
when with several other booksellers he issued a translation of La Bruydre's 
Characters. [T.C. III. 126.] Amongst other works of which he was the sole 
or joint publisher, may be noted Sir Hans Sloane's Voyage to the Islands 
Madera, Barbadoes, arc, 1707 [T.C. in. 569], Maittaire's Historia Stephano- 
rum insignium Gallm Typographer urn, 1709. [T.C. ill. 627] and the castrated 
sheets of Holinshed's Chronicle which he shared with Benj. Cowse in 1722-3, 
and which were the subject of some dispute. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd., i. 251.] 



BATEMAN. 25 

But it was chiefly as a dealer in second-hand books that he and his shop 
became famous. Dean Swift was among his customers. Writing to Stella in 
1 7 10, he says, "I went to Bateman's the bookseller and laid out eight and forty 
shillings for books. I bought three little volumes of Lucian in French, for 
our Stella." Another of his customers about the same time was Zacharias 
Conrad von Uffenbach, who visited this country in 17 10 and published an 
account of his travels in 1753-4. Extracts from this work have been 
given in J. E. B. Mayor's Cambridge under Queen Anne, 191 1, from which 
the following paragraphs are taken : " n June [17 10] Wednesday — To 
Paternoster Row, the comer house, to Badman's [sic\ store of old bound 
books, which is the best in England. Elsewhere you find few latin books, but 
here there were two shops full, and the floors piled up With books. The prices 
were however so high, that I only bought a few English historians, and 
MabiUon de re diplomatica, the last very cheap at 2 guineas." " 14th July — 
I got out at Mr. Badman's [sic\ m Paternoster |Row, and asked the price of 
MabiUon ' de re diplomatica '. The good man asked only 30^. supposing no 
doubt that the new edition had superseded the old." It is stated that 
Archbishop Sancroft's nephew sold his MS. papers for 80 guineas to Bateman 
the bookseller, from whom they were purchased by Bishop Tanner and pre- 
sented to the Bodleian Library. [D'Oyly's Life of William Bancroft, vol. II. 
p. 90.] Gough says that the MSS. were in 300 vols., but does not give the source 
of his information. [Anecdotes, p. 58.] Finally Nichols [Lit. Anecd. i. 424] 
says : " It was said that Bateman never would suffer any person whatever to 
look into one book in his shop ; and when asked a reason for it, would say, 
* I suppose you may be a physician or an author, and want some recipe or 
quotation ; and, if you buy it, I will engage it to be perfect before you leave 
me, but not after ; as I have suffered by leaves being torn out, and the books 
returned to my very great loss and prejudice.'" Nichols also records [ill. 616] 
that Bateman was holding book auctions as late as 1730. 

BATEMAN (Stephen), bookseller in London, 1686. Published Fleta Minor, 
the laws of art and nature . . . with 44 sculptures, 1686. [Haz. 11. 470-1.] 

BATEMAN (w.), bookseller in London, next the King's Head Inn, Old Change, 
1684. Advertised Lucian's Dialogues in 1684 [T.C. 11. 73], and in the same

BATES (c), bookseller in London, Sun and Bible in Giltspur Street, near Pye 
Comer, 1709-14. A dealer in ballads, broadsides, and all kinds of

by Bates and others, has a date 17 14. He is not noticed by either Dun ton or 
Timperley, nor is his name found in the Term Catalogues. Sarah Bates 
was almost certainly his widow.

[Timperley, p. 684.] 

BATTERSBY, or BATERSBY (Robert), printer in London, Staple Inn Gate, 
Holbom, 1670-1705. On June 28th, 1670, Robert Battersby entered Moliere's 
Tariuffe in the Stationers' Register [Stat. Reg., Roxb., 11. 413-] In Febmary 
167! he was called as a witness before the Committee of the House of Lords, 
which was inquiring into the publication of certain libellous pamphlets, and 
deposed that he printed an unlicensed work called The Ladies Calling, and 
that he was warned by Randal Taylor that the Company were making a 
search on a certain day. Battersby's name does not appear in the Term 
Catalogue before Michaelmas 1699, when an edition of Don Quixote was 
advertised as printed for several publishers, of whom he was one. In the 
following year he published a work on Primogeniture. [T.C. in. 154, 175.] 



BATTERSBY— BEE. «7 

Dunton has this record of him [p. 218] : "He printed The Infant's Lawyer, 
and Ars Clericalis, and has purchased other Copies that have sold well. 
He is scrupulously honest ; he never abridged another mans Copy, or pur- 
chased his Author by out-bidding." 

BATTERSBY (william), sen., bookseller in London, Thames Inn Gate, 
Holbom, near St. Andrew's Church, 1671-1701. In Mich. 167 1 he advertised

law books. Some time before the end of the year he took his son William 
into partnership and their names are jointly found in an advertisement of 
patent medicine in the City Mercury, June nth, 1694. [b.M. Burney 112 a.]

Exchange, 1692. Sold W. Jordan's Copy Book. He was more probably a

of Ralph Beckford [Madan, p. 30.] 

BECKFORD (ralph), bookbinder at Oxford, 1680 (?).

in the following year he published alone Considerations on the Trade to New- 
foundland. [Haz. III. 174,] Bell's first entry in the Term Catalogues occurs in 
Hil. 1697 as one of the publishers of Tyrrell's History of England. [T.C. ill. 4], 
and from that time until 17 11 his name occurs frequently as a miscellaneous 
publisher. In 1702 Dunton [p. 195] sold him the copyright of The Athenian

Oxford. 1 687-1 706. One of the most important booksellers of his time. He 
made his first entry in the Term Catalogues in Easter 1687 with an edition of 
Homer's Iliad by George Sylvanus. [T.C. 11. 194.] Dunton was partner with 
him in the publication of Lecrose's Works oj the Learned. Bennet had an 
extensive connexion amongst the clergy, and Bishop Atterbury, who was his 
friend and patron, has left this account of him : "I need not say how perfect 
a master he was of all the business of that useful profession wherein he had 
engaged himself. . . . His natural abilities were very good and his industry 
exceeding great, and the evenness and probity of his temper not inferior to 
either of them. Besides he had one peculiar felicity . . . that he was entirely 
contented and pleased with his lot, loving his employment for its own sake." 
He published the catalogues of Abp. Tenison's library and of Dugdale's 
bequest to the Ashmolean. Bennet married Elizabeth Whitewrong, daughter 
of James Whitewrong of Rothavestead, co. Hereford. He died on August 26th, 
1706, and was buried in St. Faith's. His stock was afterwards bought by 
J. Nicholson, William Newton, Robert Knaplock, and Benjamin Tooke. 
\T.C. III. 563.] Possibly a son of the preceding. 



30 BENNETT— BENSKIN. 

BENNETT (george), bookseller in Cork, 1714-34. The earliest mentions of 
Geo. Bennett are in February 17 14, when he printed a small single-sheet 
periodical called The Idler, and in 17 16, when he was described as a " Book- 
seller in Cork ". His second imprint extant is found in 1719, on a schoolbook 
entitled shortly A Tutor to Arithmetic. He was a member of the Cork Corpora- 
tion and elected Mayor for 1724. In 1734 he is described as "Alderman" 
and was appointed in that year to execute all printing that should be 
wanted for the Corporation. He also printed The Cork News Letter, 1723 to 
1725- 

BENNETT (james), bookseller in London, Paved Alley in St. James's Fields, 
1680. Mentioned as a disperser of unlicensed pamphlets. His wife's name was 
Grace. [Hist. MSS. Comm. Report xi. App, pt. i, p. 268.] 

BENNETT (JOSEPH), printer in London, St. Giles, Bloomsbury, 1675 (?)-9i 
A " Josias " Bennett, possibly the same, is mentioned in a list of printing houses 
drawn up in 1675, as one who had "set up since the Act was in force". [S.P.D. 
Car. II. vol. 369, p. 97.] For Richard Bentley he printed in 1679 a novel en- 
titled FaioZ Prudence [Esdaile, p. 2 11], and in 1678 was the printer of Huntington 
Diver tisement. [Haz. 11. 297.] In 1680 a Joseph Bennett, stationer of St. Giles, 
gave information against Sir Roger L' Estrange as being a Papist [House 
of Lords Journal, 1680, p. 630], and in 1685 he printed for Charles Brome 
Dangerfield's Memoirs. [Haz. 11. 297.] In 1691 he was defendant in a suit 
brought by a certain John Smith for the recovery of a debt. [C.P.R. Mich. 3, 
W. & M. 3101, m. 372, verso.] 

BENNETT (m.), printer in London, 1 701-3. Printed Sir Thomas Craig's Right 
oj Succession to the Kingdom of England, 1703. [Haz. m. 50.] 

BENSKIN (THOMAS), bookseller in London, (i) St. Bride's Churchyard ; (2) 
Green's Rents near Fleet Bridge ; (3) Little Lincoln's Inn Fields. 1681-1704. 
First heard of in 168^ as a publisher on the Protestant side during the 
Popish Plot. On March loth he issued the first number of The Protestant 
Oxford Intelligence, altered a month later to The Impartiall London Intelligence, 
or Occurrences Forraign and Domestick. On June 6th, 168 1, the Earl of 
Danby moved the Court of King's Bench that Thomas Benskin, the publisher 
of The Phanatick Intelligence, might be ordered to find bail in £1,000 to answer 



BENTLEY. 31 

a charge of scandal against the Earl, but the bail was fixed by the Court at 
£500. In the same year he issued a broadside entitled The Vindication of 
. . . James, Duke of Monmouth, [b.m. 8122. i, i, (35).] In Michaelmas Term his 
name first appears in the Term Catalogue as one of the publishers of a work 
entitled The History of the Life . . . of Queen Mary. In 1684 he moved to 
Little Lincoln's Inn Fields, but between 1682 and 1704 he made little use of the 
Term Catalogues. He was the publisher of Mrs. A. Behn's comedies The 
Round-Heads and The City Heiress. 

BENTLEY (f.), bookseller in Halifax, 1695. Publisher of The Doctrine of the 
Church of Englajtd concerning the Lord's Day. [T.C. II. 548.] 

BENTLEY (m.), bookseller in London, 1698. Apparently no relation of Richard 
Bentley (q. v.) The Term Catalogue for Mich. 1697 has an advertisement of 
L. Hennepin's New discovery of a vast country in America . . . printed for 
M. Bentley, J. Tonson, &c. [T.C. ill. 39 ; b.m. (dated 1698) 278. f. 36.] 

BENTLEY (richard), bookseller in London, Post House in Russell Street, 
Covent Garden, 1675-97. The well-known publisher of novels, plays, and 
romances, hence referred to by Dunton as " novel " Bentley. [Life &• Errors, 
p. 292.] His name first appears in the Term Catalogue of Hilary 1675 in 
partnership with J. Magnes as joint publisher of a tragedy Andromeda 
[T.C. III. 197.] and in the following year they advertised and published the 
romance of Zelinda. [Esdaile, p. 329.] As J. Magnes's name appears first in all 
the imprints, Bentley was evidently the junior partner. In the latter part 
of 1678 the firm became R. Bentley and M. Magnes and so continued until 
1682, when for a few months Bentley was publishing alone, but in the Term 
Catalogue for Michaelmas 1683 Dryden's Religio Laid was published by 
R. Bentley and S. Magnes [T.C. 11. 50.] S. Magnes's name occurs for the 
last time in Mich. 1688, after which Richard Bentley continued the business 
alone. Some time in 1688 he issued a broadside entitled The Commissioners' 
proposals to .. . the Prince of Orange, &'c. [b.m. 1850. c. 6 (6).] In 1692 Bentley 
reissued some fifty novels of the preceding fifteen years, not all bearing his 
imprint, as Modern Novels, in xii volumes, [b.m. 12410. c. 18-29.] Letters 
of his in Sir H. Ellis's Original Letters of eminent Literary Men, 1843, 
show that Bentley was both an enterprising and liberal man. Amongst 
other notable books published by him may be noticed John Evelyn's Sylva, 
and the author, writing to Dr. Richard Bentley in 1697, says that the latter's 



32 BENTLEY— BERRY. 

namesake " had sold off three impressions and was impatient for the fourth." 
But it is chiefly as a publisher of romances that Bentley is known, and in some 
" romans a clef " he adopted fictitious imprints. For example, Gabriel de 
Bremond's Hattige, or the Anwurs of the King of Tainaran, was published 
" For Simon the African, Amsterdam ", 1680 ; again. The Secret History of the 
Duke of Alangon and Q. Elizabeth, published in 1691, bore the imprint 
" For Will with the Whisp, at the sign of the Moon in the Ecliptick ", some- 
times with the addition of " Cologne." [Esdaile, pp. 169, 215.] Bentley's name 
last appears in the Term Catalogue of Easter 1697 [T.C. ill. 15] and he died 
between that date and July 6th, when his will was proved. He made his 
wife Katherine his sole executrix and he left a son Thomas. Among the 
witnesses to the will was Robert Everingham. 

BENTLEY (THOMAS), bookseller in London, Crown in Little Britain, 1688-95. 
In 1688, in partnership with B. Walford, Thomas Bentley sold by auction the 
library of William Cecil, first Baron Burleigh, and the catalogue gives his place 
of business as above. After this nothing more is known of him until 1695, when 
he married Mrs. Anne Ridley of Downham in the Isle of Ely. [Cambridge 
Parish Registers — Marriages — Knapwell, p. 145.] His name does not appear 
in the Term Catalogues. 

BENTLEY (t.), stationer at Cambridge, 1679. Admitted by the Vice-Chancellor 
and Heads to the trade of stationer in Cambridge, 1679, but on November ist, 
1679, he was " prohibited by the Vice-Chancellor and Heads from selling 
books in Cambridge till the determination of his controversy with Cambridge 
stationers ". 

BENTLEY (william), bookseller in London, 1697. Hazlitt records The 
Picture of Quakerism drawn to the Life. ... By Francis Bugg, London, 
Printed for and are to be sold by W. Bentley . . . 1697. The only copy in the 
British Museum of that date does not give Bentley as one of the publishers. 
[Haz. II. 68.]

Only known as the printer of The Evening Post, 171 1. Mentioned in Negus's

works. In partnership with William Berry. In Michaelmas 1672 they 
announced An exact Survey of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. [T.C. I. 
119.] In 1681 E. Berry's name is found in the imprint of a work entitled 
Jus Anglorum ab Antiquo.

Provinces of the Netherlands. [T.C. 1. 1 19.] In 1673 he moved from Holbom to 
the Strand and in 1679 had moved still further west to Charing Cross. He 
made his last announcement in the Term Catalogues in Michaelmas, 1703. 
[T.C. III. 382.] 

BERTRAM (william), stationer in Cambridge, in St. Edward's parish, 1693. 
On January 26th, 1693 the Vice-Chancellor licensed him to keep a " Common 
Alehouse or Tippling-house " within the Town of Cambridge. [Cooper's Annals 
of Cambridge, IV. 25.] 

BETTENHAM (james), printer in London, St. John's Lane, i7i2(?)-74. 
Is believed to have been bom in 1683, but no particulars are obtainable as to 
his life before the year 17 12, when he married the step-daughter of William 
Bowyer the elder. This took place shortly before the fire which destroyed 
Bowyer's premises. Nichols [Lit. Anecd. i. 65] furnishes almost all that 
is known about him. He refers to Bettenham as "a printer of no small 
eminence in his profession, which he pursued with unabated industry and 
reputation till the year 1766, when he retired from business, and died Feb. 6, 
1774, of a gradual decay, at the advanced age of 91. To shew the un- 
certainty of human affairs, this worthy man, after carrying on a respectable 
and extensive business for more than 60 years, left behind him not quite 
£400. . . . His first wife died Dec. 8, 17 16, aged 30 ; and he had a second 
who died July 9, 1735, aged 39." Amongst those who served their apprentice- 
ship in his office was F. Kirkby, the successor of J. Abree the Canterbury 
printer and the partner of J. Simmons of that city. Bettenham will always be 
remembered as one of those who helped to finance William Caslon the First

and set him up as a type founder. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. ii. 356, 720.] Negus in 
his list of printers in 1724 described Bettenham as a Non-juror. Most 
of his work as a printer lies beyond the limit of this volume, but it may be 
noted that amongst other things he was the printer in 1721 of Vita Johannis 
Barwick. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. I. 217.] 

BETTESWORTH (Arthur), bookseller in London, Red Lion on London 
Bridge, 1699-1737. Chiefly a publisher of divinity, though he published 
many novels, &c., and, like all the booksellers on the Bridge, dealt in some 
questionable literature. {See Post Boy, January nth, 17 n.] His daughter 
Elizabeth married Charles Hitch, bookseller of Paternoster Row, in partner- 
ship with whom her father had published many books. [Timperley, p. 713.] 

BEVER (THOMAS), bookseller in London, Hand and Star, within Temple Bar ; 
(a) next the Middle Temple Gate, (i) by, {c) near. Temple Bar. 1689-17 12.

Alphonso, King of Naples, A Tragedy, by Geo. Powell, 1691, and England's 
Glory ; Or, The Great improvement of Trade in General, by H. M., 1694. 
In 1 7 13 he subscribed one guinea to the Bowyer relief fund. Dunton [p. 226] 
has this character of him : " Mr. Bever, in Fleet Street, had ever the character 
of being a very merciful, just, and peaceable man, never intermeddling with 
state matters. He is a constant hearer at St. Dunstan's church. ... I shall 
only add, he has a large acquaintance amongst the lawyers, and is himself 
a very thriving bookseller." The premises he occupied were those once 
tenanted by Richard Tottell, and bore the same sign.

ing to Dunton [p. 230] he suffered for some years from a mental disorder 
during which time his wife and son managed the business. His name appears 
in the Term Catalogues for the last time in Trinity Term 1698 [T.C. m. 83], 
but in 1706 he published the ninth edition of Nathaniel Strong's England's

In 17 12 he published C. Owen's Hymns sacred to the Lord's Table, printed for 
him by S. Terry at Liverpool. By 1722 he had set up a press of his ovm, for 
we find him then printing H. Wosterholme's Sermon . . . for promoting the

ments, 1908, pp. 333-4.] 

BIRD (JOHN ?), bookseller in London, Sun in Westminster Hall, 1683-89. 
This bookseller is perhaps the John Bird, son-in-law to Richard Andrew, 
stationer, {q. v.) who died in 1683. He had a stall in Westminster Hall 
during Easter Term 1689. Two books were advertised by him in the Term 
Catalogue. [T.C. 11. 243, 249.]

. lived in St. Martin's parish, as the Register has several entries of his family. 
[Dredge, f. 10.] The first book recorded by Dredge as published by him 
was a Sermon preached in the Cathedral Church of . . . Exon., by William 
Chilcot, M.A., on April 4th, 1697. [Ibid.] He appears to have died about 1716 
and was succeeded by his widow (?) M. Bishop, and later by his son George* 
Dunton [p. 237] speaks of him as " a firm adherer to the Established Govern- 
ment, and a declared enemy to Popery and Slavery ... a man of strict justice, 
deals much and thrives of his trade ". 

BIXOU alias TABB (l,), printer in Limerick, 1722-23 ? Worked with

England and Wales issued during 1673 and the fifth edition of Guillim's 
Heraldry in 1679. 

BLOUNT, or BLUNT (charles), bookseller in London ; (i) Black-Raven 
between Worcester House and the Savoy, near the Bear Tavern, Strand ; 
by the New Exchange ; (2) The Catherine Wheel, Charing Cross. 1678-84* 
Publisher of medical books, plays and novels. Amongst the latter may be 
noticed The Mock Clelia, advertised in Mercurius Civicus, April 22nd, 1680, 
and A. Oldys's Fair Extravagant, 1681 [T.C. I. 461]. In the same number he 
also advertised a translation of one of the novels of Cervantes, called The 
Jealous Gentletnan of Estretnadura. His last advertisement was in the issue 
of Michaelmas 1684. [T.C. II. 97.] Blunt moved to the Catherine Wheel about 
1680. 

BLOW (jAMES), printer in Belfast, 1706-58. Succeeded Patrick Neill. His 
earliest extant imprint is dated 1706. While very largely of a religious 
character the output of his press included secular works. Blow was connected 
by marriage with Geo. Grierson who married his widowed sister. The allega- 
tion that Blow printed a Bible in 1704 is now admitted as untenable. Blow 
did not claim to do so but he certainly did claim in an advertisement of 
works printed and sold by himself an edition of the Holy Bible in several vols, 
and the N.T., but no copy is extant or recorded elsewhere. The edition of 
1757 commonly called " Blow's Bible " is the earliest one extant from his press. 

BLUNT, su Blount. 



40 BODDINGTON— BONNY. 

BODDINGTON (m.), bookseller in London, Duck Lane, 171 1-25. Published 
in 171 1 in partnership with N. Boddington, Thos. Lydal's AccomptanVs 
Assistant. In 1722 the twentieth edition of the first part of Bunyan's 
Pilgrim's Progress was printed by A. Wilde for M. Bodington. [bm. 4414. 
de, 27.] 

BODDINGTON (Nicholas), bookseller in London, Golden Ball, Duck Lane, 
1687-17 17. This bookseller was perhaps a descendant of George Boddington 
(1648). He began as a publisher in 1687, when he advertised The Gentleman's 
new Jockey ar Farrier's approved guide. [T.C. II. i88.] In 1693 he published 
the thirteenth edition of the First Part of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress for 
R. Ponder. In a law suit instituted in 1697 by Nathaniel Ponder, who held 
the copyright, against Thomas Braddyll, Boddington deposed that he bought 
ten thousand copies of this edition and paidBraddyll at the rateof five shillings 
per ream for them, although he had agreed with Ponder that he was to have 
them at four and sixpence a ream. Boddington gave his age as forty-five or 
thereabouts. Dunton [p. 209] has the following account of him : " By an 
industrious management he has gathered a good estate, and makes a con- 
siderable figure in the Parish where he lives. He deals much in Bibles, 
Testaments and Common Prayer Books. He purchased Mr. Reach's Travels 
of true Godliness of me, and deals much in the country." From 17 11 he was 
publishing in partnership with M. Boddington (g. v.) who succeeded him. 

BODVELL or BODRELL (peter), see Diaionary, 1641-67. 

BOLDERO (ARTHUR), bookseller in London, Mitre, Mitre Court, Fleet Street, 
near the Inner Temple, 1677. Only known by a little octavo called Poor 
Robin's Visions, which he published in 1677. [T.C. i. 283 ; Haz. I. 361.] 

BOLTON (s.), bookseller in London (?) 1713. Publisher of the sixth edition of 
J. Arbuthnot's Complete Key to Law is a Bottomless Pit, 1713. [Esdaile, p. 152.] 

BONNY (william), printer in London and Bristol : Bristol, (i) Tower Lane, 
1695 ; (2) Near the Tolzey, 1699 ; (3) Small Street, 1703 ; (4) Com Street. 
1691-1714. Began business as a printer in London and was employed by John 
Dunton to print Baxter's Directions to the Unconverted, Cotton Mather's Tryals 
of several Witches, and Dunton's own Pleasant art of Money Catching. He is 
favourably mentioned for his just dealing by Dunton [pp. 247-8], who suggests 



BONWICKE. 41 

that his migration to Bristol was due to money losses. This took place in the 
early part of 1695, the Chamber of the City coming to the conclusion that a 
printing press might be useful in several respects, but not being disposed to 
allow a " foreigner " to compete with local booksellers in their special business, 
granted him the freedom on condition that he dwelt in the city and exercised 
no trade save that of a printer. His first book printed in Bristol was An 
Essay on the State of England in relation to its Trade, its Poor and its Taxes. 
" By John Gary, Merchant in BristoU ; Bristoll, Printed by W. Bonny for the 
author and are to be sold in London. . . . Also by Tho. Wall and Rich. Gravett 
near the Tolzey in Bristol, Novem. 1695." In 1696 he printed (i) a broadside 
entitled, The Hwnble Presentment of tlie Grand Inquest at Midsummer Sessions ; 
(2) Mr. John Cory's Proposals for the better tnaintaining and Imploying the Poor 
of t/ie City of Bristoll ; and (3) The Banner of CoraJi, Dathan and Abiram displayed 
. . . Sermons preach' d at Bristol, by John Moore. In 1702 he became the editor 
and publisher of a newspaper called The Bristol Post Boy which is believed to 
have appeared in November, but the earliest known copy of which is that of 
August 1 2th, 1704. In one of its issues he announced that he was ready to buy 
old rope and paper stuff, and to sell Bibles, Welsh Prayer Books, paper hang- 
ings, music, maps, blank ale licenses, and blank commissions for private men 
of war ; and in May 17 12 he had very good Bridgewater peas and excellent 
charcoal for sale. The Post Boy cannot be traced beyond May 17 12. Another 
of his publications was the Rev. Arthur Bedford's Evil and Danger of Stage 
Plays, 1706. When Dunton wrote (1703) Bonny was " stark blind ". 

BONWICKE (henry), bookseller in London, Red Lion, St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1677-1706. Son of the Rev. John Bonwicke and uncle of Ambrose Bonwicke 
the younger, whose life under the title of A Pattern for Young Students, was 
pubUshed by Professor Mayor in 1870. Dunton writes of him [p. 2 16] " I do not 
think there is an honester man in London, or one that is more zealous for the 
church. He served his time with Mr. Benjamin Tooke." He dealt chiefly in 
works of divinity but published also medical books and books on music. He 
died in 1706. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. V. 119.] Two letters from him to Strype 
are printed in iV. 6* Q., August 29th, 1859, p. 343. Rebecca Bonwicke {q. v.) 
may have been his widow. 

BONWICKE (JAMES), bookseller in London, (i) Hat and Star, St. Paul's 
Churchyard; (2) Red Lion, St. Paul's Churchyard. 1699-1714 ? His relation- 



42 BONWICKE— BOULTER. 

ship to Henry Bonwicke is not clear. His first entry was of a City sermon, in 
1699. [T.C. III. 134.] After the death of Henry Bonwicke he moved to the 
Red Lion and was in partnership with Rebecca Bonwicke. They were still 
publishing in 1711. In 17 14 James subscribed for Walker's Sufferings of the 
Clergy. 

BONWICKE (REBECCA), bookseller in London, Red Lion, St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1706-11 ? Perhaps the widow of Henry Bonwicke. She was joined after his 
death by James Bonwicke, and they were still publishing in 17 11 and probably 
later. 

BOOMER (t.), bookseller in London, White Horse in Ludgate Street, i686« 
His name is found in the imprint to The Book of Bertram, priest and Monk of 
Corby. [T.C. II. 164.] 

BOSVILLE (ALEXANDER), bookseller in London, The Dial in Fleet Street, 169! J 
(2) The Dial and Bible in Fleet Street, 1703. 1696-1709. Publisher, largely 
of broadsides. Identical with Dunton's " Mr. Boswill " [p. 210]. His first 
appearance in the Term Catalogue is in Mich. 1696. [T.C. II. 599.] In the 
same year he published Motteux's comedy Love's a Jest. [T.C. II. 602.] 
He is last met with in the Term Catalogues in Hil. 1709. [T.C. ill. 630.] 
His shop was taken by Edmund Curll in 1711. 

BOTHAM (w.), printer in London, Jewin Street, 1700-25. Printed Dampier's 
New Voyage round the World for James Knapton. In 1713 he contributed to 
Bowyer's relief fund, and in 1724 is mentioned in Negus's List of Printers as 
" well affected to King George ". [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. I. 290.] 

BOUGES(j.), bookseller (.?) in London, Castle in Westminster Hall, 1700. Appears 
to have had a stall in Westminster Hall in Mich. 1700, when he advertised in 
the Term Catalogue A new book, wherein is given the whole . . . Account the 
Scriptures gives of the Deity, 6*^. [T.C. III. 212.] It seems doubtful if he was 
a bookseller. 

BOULTER (ROBERT). See Dictionary, 1641-67. Still in business in 1679, when 
he published, or at least sold, Bedloe's Narrative of the Burning of London. 
In 1674-5 the widow of Thomas Underbill transferred to him all her late 
husband's copyrights, most of these being works of divinity. [Stat. Reg., 
Roxb., II. 64.] His name appears in the Term Catalogues for the last time in 
Hil. 1683. [T.C. II. 4.] See Bowter (R.). 



BOURN— BOWMAN. 43

167I. [Lawler, Book Auctions in England, p. 117 ; b.m. 821. i. i. (3).] 

BO WEN (j.), bookseller in London, i68i. Hazlitt records A Poem {by way of 
Elegie) upon Mr. Stephen CoUedge, 1681, printed for him. [Haz. II. 134.]

states \T.C. ill. 701, Index] that John and Thomas Bowles sold G. de I'lsle's 
map [Theatrum Historicum] ; the announcement referred to [ill. 647] mentions 
neither, but their names appear on the map itself [b.m. maps 100 (3).].

a relation. [T.C. i. 319.] His books were sold by auction at Oxford in February 
i68f. [Life and Times of Anthony Wood, Oxford Hist. Soc. vol. ill, p. 213.] 

BOWTELL (WILLIAM), printer in London, (i) Golden Key in Fleet Street, near 
Mitre Court ; (2) Star, Cheapside, near Mercers' Chapel, 1675-9. Bowtell's 
name occurs in a List of Printing Houses in London, drawn up in March 1675, 
as one of those who had " set up since the Act was in force " [S.P.D. Car. II, 
vol. 369-97]. His name appears in the Term Catalogue of Trinity Term, 1676, 
as selling a medical work [T.C. 1. 246]. Nothing is heard of him after 1679 
[T.C. 1. 342]. Dunton [p. 293] calls him " generous Bowtel ". He was possibly 
a descendant of Stephen Bowtell, 1643-64. [See Dictionary, 1641-67.] 

BOWTER = BOULTER ? (Robert), stationer in London and Edinburgh, 1687. 
Will registered in Edinburgh, July 22nd, 1687. [Aldis, p. 109.] See Boulter (R.). 

BOWYER (edward), stationer in London, i686. His name occurs in a law- 
suit in this year. [C.P.R. 3042. m. 511, recto.] 

BOWYER (JONAH or jONAs), bookseller in London, Rose, Ludgate Street, (a) 
the corner of St. Paul's Churchyard, (b) near the West End of St. Paul's 
Churchyard, 1705-22. Nichols states that this bookseller was no relation 
to William Bowyer the printer. He succeeded W. Hawes at the Rose in 1705, 
and his first pubhcation was a divinity book [T.C. III. 436.] In 17 13 he gave 
a subscription of two guineas to the Bowyer Fund. Lintot is said to have 
bought of him a half share in Lauderdale's Virgil for £5 75. 6d. [Nichols, Lit. 
Anecd. vili. 294.] In September 1722 he gave Harley some papers, [lb. i. 9.] 

BOWYER (WILLIAM), the elder, printer in London, (i) White Horse in Little 
Britain ; (2) Dogwell Court, Whitefriars. 1699-1737. Son of John Bowyer, 
citizen and grocer of London, by Mary daughter of William King, citizen and 
vintner of London. Born in 1663, apprenticed to Miles Fletcher, printer, in 
1679, and made free of the Company of Stationers in 1686. By his first wife 
he had no issue. He married secondly Dorothy, daughter of Thomas Dawks, 
printer and widow of Benjamin Allport, bookseller. In 1699 he was in 
business as a printer at the White Horse in Little Britain. In the same year 
he removed to Dogwell Court, where on January 29th, 17^1 a fire destroyed 
his printing house with his plant and the MSS. and sheets of many important 
books. A subscription, amounting to £2,539, by Bowyer's fellow printers 
and the booksellers, was collected for his relief. Most of the finest books of the 



BOWYER— BRADDYLL. 45 

time are the work of the Bowyer press. Negus calls Bowyer a Non-juror. 
In 1722 he took his son William into partnership. Bowyer died December 27th, 
1737, and was buried in the church of Low Leyton, Essex. [Nichols, Lit. 
Anecd.; D.N.B.] 

BOWYER (WILLIAM), the younger, printer in London, (i) Dogwell Court, 
White Friars, 1722-67 ; (2) Cicero's Head, Red Lion Passage, Fleet Street, 
1767-77. 1722-77. Only son of William Bowyer the elder, q. v., by his 
second wife ; born on December 19th, 1699. Most of his career lies outside 
our period, but a brief account may be given of " the most learned printer 
of the eighteenth century." He entered St. John's College, Cambridge, as 
a sizar, in 17 16, and won a Roper Exhibition there, but did not take a degree. 
While still at Cambridge he began to assist his father in the work of reading for 
the press, and in 1722 was taken in as a partner ; he continued as " corrector ", 
his father retaining the management. In 1728 he married Anne Prudom, his 
mother's niece. At the elder Bowyer's death in 1737 he carried on the office 
alone. In 1729 the firm had been appointed printers of the Commons' Votes, 
and in 1736 printers to the Society of Antiquaries. The younger Bowyer was 
soon elected a Fellow of the Antiquaries, and contributed many papers, which 
were collected and published in 1785 by John Nichols. In 1754 he entered 
into a partnership with a near relative, James Emonson, which lasted till 
1757, when John Nichols, then aged 12, was placed under him, and was soon 
entrusted with the management of the office, becoming his partner in 1766. 
He died on November i8th, 1777, aged 77. Nichols's Literary Anecdotes is an 
expansion of a memoir of the two Bowyers with an annotated list of their 
productions. 

BRADDYLL (thomas), printer in London, 1680-1704 (?) Braddyll is first 
heard of in 1680, when he printed for Robert Clavell The Rights of Bishops to 
judge in Capital Cases in Parliament cleared, and in the following year for the 
same bookseller The Annals of King James and King Charles the First. [Haz* 
11. 50, III. 87.] In 1680 Nathaniel Ponder, in the fourth edition of Pilgrim's 
Progress, accused Braddyll of printing surreptitious and unauthorized editions 
of the book and spoke of him as a " land pirate ". At the same time he 
appears to have subsequently employed Braddyll to print an edition for him, as 
appears by a series of documents in a law suit which Ponder brought against 
Braddyll in 1697. According to the story there told, he gave Braddyll an 
order to print an edition of ten thousand copies at four shillings and sixpence 



46 BRADDYLL— BRADLEY. 

a ream, and he accused Braddyll of defrauding him, and further declared that 
he was the author and printer of the Third Part, in which by transporting 
a great part of the original work, especially the titles, he hindered the sale of the 
plaintiff's copies. Braddyll in reply gave a complete answer to these charges, 
and further stated that while Ponder was a prisoner for debt in the King's 
Bench Prison he (Braddyll) had spent a sum of £14 on behalf of Ponder's son. 
He denied having anything to do with the publication of the Third Part of 
The Pilgrim's Progress. Dunton [p. 251] gives the following character of 
Braddyll : " Mr. Braddyll is a first rate printer and has always been a very 
active diligent man. He is religiously true to his word and faithful to the 

booksellers that employ him He was once a good friend to Sir R. L'Estrange 

when matters looked a little dark upon him." In 1704 Braddyll was the 
printer of the fourth edition of P\uta.Tch's Morals for J. Taylor [T.C. III. 417] 
after which nothing more is known of him. 

BRADFORD (john) printer in London, (i) Bible in Fetter Lane ; (2) Little 
Britain ; (3) New Street, without Bishopsgate ; (4) Bible, in Westmoreland 
Court. 1685-1709. There was more than one printer of this name in London 
in the latter part of the seventeenth century, and it is difficult to distinguish 
them. There was first John Bradford, brother of William Bradford the 
Quaker, and it seems probable that the work entitled. The Protestant Martyrs ; 
or the Bloody Assizes, 1685, came from his press. John Bradford was present 
at his brother William's marriage to Elizabeth Sowle in February 1685, and 
he is believed to have subsequently gone to America. Another John Bradford 
is found between 1697 and 1709 printing theological books. [T.C. III. 36, 122.] 
In 1704 he printed Proceedings at the Old Bailey, in which his imprint is given 
as the " Bible in Westmoreland Court ". J. How refers to John Bradford as 
a printer of other men's copies. [Some Thoughts on the present State of Printing 
and Bookselling, p. 12.I 

BRADLEY (job), bookseller in Chesterfield, 1725-98. In 1725 he sold Charles 
Cotton's Wonders of the Peak. [Haz. ill. 49.] Later he became a printer as well 
as a bookseller, and served the office of Alderman of Chesterfield, where he 
died in February 1798. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. iii. 672.] 

BRADLEY (william), bookseller in London, Three Bibles, Minories, 1670. 
Sold Grammaticus Analyticus, 1670, a Latin Grammar composed for the use of 
the Free School in East Smithfield. [T.C. i. 43, 49.] 



BRADWELL-BRENT. 47 

BRAD WELL (thomas), printer in London, 168 1. Defendant in an action for 
assault brought by Bartholomew Sprint, bookseller, against several printers 
and booksellers of London and Oxford in 1681. Details are wanting. [C.P.R. 
Trinity 33 Chas. II. 2992. m. 265.] 

BRAGG (benjamin), printer and bookseller in London, (i) White Hart, Fleet 
Street, over against the end of Water Lane ; (2) Blue Ball, Ave Mary Lane, 
near Ludgate Street ; (3) Black Raven in Paternoster Row, over against Ivy 
Lane End. 1694-1709 ? Began business as a bookseller in Fleet Street in 
1694, amongst his publications in that year being Miscellaneous Letters and 
Essays on several subjects . . .by several Ladies and Gentlemen. \T.C. II. 512.] 
He then disappears from the Term Catalogues for ten years, his next appear- 
ance being in Hilary 1704, when he published An Account of the Proceedings 
of the Parliament of Scotland, May 6th, 1703. [T.C. in. 391.] He was the 
printer of a broadside entitled A New Express from Holland, July 12th, 1703, 
[Bibl. Lind., Broadsides, No. 840.] He had then moved to Ave Mary Lane, 
where he published several of Defoe's writings. In 1706 he moved again to 
Paternoster Row, and between that date and 1709 he published numerous books 
of all kinds. Dunton, whose Whipping Post he printed in 1706, has [p. 210] 
this character of Bragg : " He was formerly a Bookseller and is now a publisher 
in Ave Mary Lane. He has been unhappy . . . yet ... is of a soft, easy, affable 
temper . . . and being just in his dealings is like to have constant employ- 
ment." Hazlitt notices several books without dates, with Bragg's imprint, 
[i. 165, II. 282.] 

BRAY (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, (i) in Exeter Court near Exeter 
Exchange in the Strand ; (2) Bell and Dragon, {a) at Charing Cross, {b) between 
Charing Cross and Whitehall. 1709-20 ? His name is first met with in the 
Term Catalogue for 1708-9 as the publisher of Reflections on men's prejudices 
against Religion. [T. C. III. 610]. He may or may not have been related to the 
Rev. Thos. Bray, Minister of St. Botolph's, Aldgate, whose funeral sermon 
on a Mr. John Dent he published in 1709. \T. C. III. 637.] He also issued 
an undated reprint of Terra Australis Incognita, 1617. [Haz. I. 18.] 

BREACH ( ), Mrs., see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

BRENT (JOHN), printer in Dublin, (i) at the Post-Ofiice-Coffee-House in 
Fishamble Street ; (2) at the back of Dick's Coffee-House (?) ; and in Cork. 



48 BRENT— BRICE. 

1691-1700 ? Two imprints of this printer dated at Dublin in 1691 are extant, 
then he L found in Cork in the same year, but in 1697 he is again in Dublin 
printing in partnership with J. Brocas (q. v.) and S. Powell at the Post-Office- 
Coflfee-House in Fishamble Street. In 1698 we find as an imprint " J. B. & 
S. P." clearly indicating that either John Brent or John Brocas was in 
partnership with S. Powell in this year ; but in 1699 each of these three 
printers has his own imprint separately as if they had severed all partnership. 
There occurs, however, one imprint of " J. B. & S. P." in 1699, and the place 
of printing is given as " at the Back of Dick's CofiFee-House ", and this place 
forms the place of imprint in 1700 without any printer's name and " J, B. & 
S. P." also occurs in 1700. So possibly John Brent was still at work in 1700* 

BREWSTER (ANN), see Dictionary, 1641-67. Widow of Thomas Brewster. 
In the Proceedings in the House of Lords, i67f , about libellous pamphlets, 
she was said by Meame to be of " Cocking's Conventicle ", and was more than 
once in trouble for printing or causing to be printed books against Church 
and State. 

BREWSTER (edward), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

BRIANT (g.), bookseller (?) in London, King's Head, Comhill, near the Royal 
Exchange, 1703. Published, with R. Billing, W. Leyboum's Mathematical 
Institutions [T. C. in. 370] ; but was perhaps a mathematical instrument 
maker and not a bookseller. 

BRICE (ANDREW), printer in Exeter, Head of the Serge-Market, in South-gate 
Street ; and in Truro. 1714-73. Only the early part of the career of this 
well-known printer comes within the scope of this work : but it may be of 
interest to give an outline of his life as given in Timperley. Andrew Brice 
was bom at Exeter in 1690 of parents neither low nor eminent, who designed 
him for a dissenting minister and gave him a grammatical education. But 
at the age of seventeen some other vocation had to be found for him and 
he was apprenticed to Joseph Bliss the Exeter printer {q. v.) for five years. 
He ran away, married, and enlisted as a soldier ; but friends procured his 
discharge, and in 17 14 he commenced business as a printer, having only 
a fount of Great Primer for everything, including a newspaper, called The 
Post-Master, or the Loyal Mercury, begun in 17 18, for which he carved the 
title in wood. Brice became involved in law suits and for seven years was 



BRIDGE— BRINGHURST. 49 

confined to his own house as a debtor. He appears to have carried on his 
printing business nevertheless. He employed women in his printing office. 
At the time of his retirement from business, he was the oldest master printer 
in England. He died November 14th, 1773, aged 83. At one time Brice had 
a press at Truro, Cornwall, but the business did not suceed and he removed 
the printing material to Exeter. 

BRIDGE (d.), printer in London, 1706, see Bridge (S.). 

BRIDGE (s.), printer and bookseller in London, (i) in Austen Friars, near the 
Royal Exchange ; (2) Little Moor-Fields. 1699-1724. In Hil. 1699 F. Saun-

[T.C. II. 340.] Sometime in 1691 he moved to the Unicom and was in partner-

ship with A. Swalle as publisher of classics and history. In 1697, they appear to 
have dissolved partnership and Childe returned to the White Hart. A list of 
books published for him is given on sig. b 4** of T. Heamc's Ductor Historicus, 
1 704. His last entry in the Term Catalogues was in Easter 1711, when he shared 
with the Churchills the publication of Moll's Atlas. [T.C. III. 672.] 

CHISWELL (RICHARD). See Dictionary, 1641-67. In a manuscript note, dated 
1661, in a copy of A. Golnitz, Ulysses Belgico-Gallicus, 1631, Chiswell 
describes himself as " servant to Mr. John Sherley ", i.e. the bookseller of 
that name, q. v. in Dictionary, 1641-67. In Mich. i68i, Chiswell was defendant 
in a suit for debt brought by Richard Hughes. [C.P.R. 2996. m. 260 r.] On 
January i6th, i68i he began to publish Weekly Memorials /or the Ingenious, 
or, an account of books lately set forth in several languages, Ssrc. 

CHOWN (ROBERT), bookseller in Northampton (?), 1684. Hazlitt records a single 
sheet : The Speech of Robert Clerk, Esq., Deputy Recorder of Northampton to

II. p. 428.] 

CHURCHILL (awnsham), bookseller in London, (a) Black Swan, Ave Mary 
Lane ; (b) at the lower end of Paternoster Row, near Amen Comer. 168 1-1728. 
Son of William Churchill, bookseller of Dorchester. Apprenticed to George 
Sawbridge. His name first appears in the Term Catalogues in Mich. 1681, as 
the publisher of a law-book. The Touchstone of Precedents. [T.C. i. 460.] 
Another early publication of his was Dr. William Saywell's Evangelical and 
Catholick Unity, which bore the imprint, "Printed for Robert Scott and 
Awnsham Churchill, at the Black Swan, near Amen Comer, 1682." This 
Robert Scott was no doubt the bookseller of that name whose shop was in 
Little Britain. Churchill soon became one of the first publishers of the day, 
and in 1690 he took into partnership his brother John, the first work recorded 
under their joint names being A second Letter concerning Toleration. [T.C. u. 
323.] Of their numerous publications, one or two only can be noted. In 
1691 they shared in the publication of Sir R. L'Estrange's Fables of Aesop. 
With Jacob Tonson they shared Selden's Table Talk in 1696, and in the same 
year they published alone John Locke's Several Papers relating to Money. 
In 1704 they issued A Collection of Voyages and Travels, 4 vols, fol., and 
between 1704 and 1715 Rymer's Foedera, 16 vols. fol. Granger refers to 
Awnsham Churchill as the greatest bookseller and stationer of his time. 



70 CHURCHILL— CLARK. 

while Dunton [p. 204] says of the brothers : " They were of an universal trade. 
I traded very considerably with them for several years, and must do them 
the justice to say that I was never concerned with any persons more exact 
in their accompts and more just in their pajnnents." Awnsham Churchill 
amassed a considerable fortune and bought an estate in Dorset. He was M.P. 
for Dorchester between 1705 and 1710. He died unmarried on April 24th, 
1728, his will being proved on May nth. It contains the following clauses : 
" I give and bequeath my books at Henbury and my bound books in London 
and Westminster to be divided equally between my three nephews Wm. 
Churchill, Awnsham Churchill and Joshua Churchill. I give and devise my 
shop in Dorchester now in possession of the widow Wentworth, to my nephew 
Wm. Churchill, Esq." He also left a bequest to Mrs. Mary Churchill, widow 
of his brother John Churchill. [P.C.C. 142. Brook.] 

CHURCHILL (john), bookseller in London, Black Swan in Paternoster Row, 
1690-17 14. Brother of Awnsham Churchill, with whom he was in partner- 
ship from 1690 till 1 7 14, soon after which he probably died, leaving three 
sons, two of them, Joshua and William, being booksellers. 

CHURCHILL (JOSHUA), printer in London, i688-i 728. Son of John Churchill (?) 
Printed for his brother (?) William Churchill a broadside entitled, A Paper

Churchill. In 1717 a patent for furnishing stationery was granted to William

ley, pp. 615, 659.] 

CLARK, or CLARKE ( ), bookseller at York and Kingston-upon-Hull, 

1 68 1-9 1. His name occurs in an advertisement of the sale of Dr. W. Outram's 
library in the London Gazette of November i7th-2ist, 1681. In 1691 " Clarke 
of York " was sued by Edward Darrell for payment for goods supplied. 
[C.P.R. Mich. 3 W. & M. Roll 3101.] Probably same as Clarke (Thomas), q.v. 

CLARK (ANDREW), printer in London, Aldersgate Street, 1670-8. In 1670 he, 
with E. Cotes, printed for Henry Brome The History of the Duke of Espernon. 



CLARK. 71 

[Haz. I. 147.] He was also the printer of the Term Catalogue of Hil. 167I 
[T.C. I, 202], and he is mentioned in the 1675 list of printers in London [S.P.Di 
Car. IL vol. 369, 97], but his name rarely appeared in an imprint except in 
the form of the initials A. C. He is last mentioned in the Term Catalogue 
of Easter 1677 [T.C. i. 279], but he published in 1678 The Death and Burial 
of Mistress Money, sold by T. Vere and J. Clarke. [Pepys 363 (563) ; Haz. 
I. 492.] Nichols records that he succeeded James Flesher as printer to the 
City of London in 1672, and that in 1679 Samuel Roycroft was appointed 
to that office. [Lit. Anecd. m. 571.] In 1675 ^^ printed a news sheet called 
The City Mercury or Advertisements concerning Trade. [Bumey 75 a.] 
Clark died about 1677 or 1678, and was succeeded by his widow Mary 
(q. v.). 

CLARK, or CLARKE (benjamin), printer and bookseller in London, George 
Yard, Lombard Street, 1674-98. Printer and publisher for the Quakers. 
In their records at Devonshire House are the following entries : " At a

hereafter A. S. [i.e. Andrew Sowle] B. C. [? Benjamin Clark] nor no other 
print any booke but what is first read and approv'd of in this meeting." A. S. 
and B. C. appear as the Society's publishers in another minute of the 26th, 
2nd Month, 1675. In 1680 he published A Test and Protest against Popery 
from the conscientious Christian Protestants, coiled Quakers, [b.m. T. 407. (4**).] 
Naturally the Quaker books did not find their way into the Term Catalogues, 
which was confined strictly to authorized publications ; but Benjamin Clark 
dealt in other literature as well, and his name frequently occurs in the Cata- 
logues between the years 1679 ^^^ 1698 as a publisher of school-books, &c. 
[T.C. I. 342, III. 57.] Dunton [p. 292] refers to him as " Thee and Thou 
Clarke ". 

CLARK, or CLARKE (francis), printer in London, 1687-8. Mentioned by 
Dunton [p. 249] as having printed his Remains. In 1687 he was surety for 
Francis Leach the printer, in a plea of debt brought by Thomas Malthus. 
[C.P.R. 3056 m. 32 recto, Easter 3. Jas. II.] In 1688 he printed an edition 
of Thomas Deloney's Garden of Good Will for G. Conyers. [Haz. H. 154.] 
His name does not occur in the Term Catalogues, and his address has not 
been found, but it may possibly have been the same as that of Henry 
Clark (g. v.). 



72 CLARK— CLARKE. 

CLARK, or CLARKE (henry), printer in London, near St. Paul's Wharf in 
Thames Street, 1687-91. Possibly a relative of Francis Clark. This supposi- 
tion is strengthened by Dunton [p. 249], who speaks of him as chief printer 
to T. Malthus, with whom Francis Clark had some business transactions. 
Dunton goes on to say that Henry Clark was diligent and dispatchful in his 
business. After his death his widow employed Mr. Sedgwick to manage the 
business and afterwards to better purpose J. Barber. In 1687 he printed 
a tract entitled Relief of Apprentices wronged by their masters. Amongst 
other publishers who employed Clark to print for them, may be mentioned 
Dorman Newman, T. Northcott, and J. Taylor.

See Dictionary, 1641-67. 



CLARKE— CLAVELL. 73 

CLARKE (john), jun., bookseller in London, Mercer's Chapel, 1651-78. See 
Dictionary, 1641-67, where the terminal date 1690 is probably incorrect.

CLEAVE (ISAAC), bookseller in London, Star in Chancery Lane, 1678-1711.

of a book against Rome. [T.C. i. 306.] In 1681 he became the publisher of 
a news sheet called The Popish Mass Display'd, No. i of which appeared on 
April 20 (with a misprint of the year as 167 1). Only two issues are known. 
[b.m. Burney 81 a.] He was also a publisher of law-books, and Dunton [p. 228] 
describes him as well known to lawyers of the first rank and having printed 
several eminent trials. Amongst these latter was The Tryal 0/ Sir William 
Parkins knt.,Jor . . . conspiracy to assassinate . . . King William III, 1696, 
Cleave was still publishing in 17 11, in which year an advertisement in the

of John Shower's Serious Reflections on Time and Eternity with the imprint, 
" Printed for S. Clement at the Sun in St. Paul's Churchyard " (which we 
suspect to be a misprint for " Swan "). [T.C. 11. 458.] 



CLEMENTS— CLIFF. 75 

CLEMENTS (henry), bookseller in Oxford, 1684-1721. Apprenticed to 
Richard Davis, bookseller of Oxford. On May 26th, 168 1, he married his

In 1691, in company with G. West, he published Gerard Langbaine's Account 
of the English Dramatick Poets [T.C. ii. 358], and in 1693, with West and 
Crosley, William Somner's Treatise of the Roman Ports and Forts in Kent. 
[T.C. II. 476]. On the death of Thomas Bennet, who seems to have been his 
London agent, Clements took over his business in London at the Half-Moon 
in St. Paul's Churchyard, in addition to his shop at Oxford. In 1692 Clements 
was a witness for Clarendon in his libel action against Wood. In his deposi- 
tions Clements gave his age as about forty-seven. Mr. Clark [ti.] gives the 
date of Clements's death as 17 21. 

CLEMENTS (henry), bookseller in London, Half-Moon, St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1707-19. It is not clear whether this bookseller was not identical with the 
bookseller at Oxford of the same name, as the name appears twice in the 
proposals for printing Corpus Omnium Veterum Poetarutn Latinorum in 1709, 
once for London and once for Oxford. [T.C. ill. 656.] Mr. Arber refers to 
the London man as " the younger ", Clements succeeded T. Bennet at the 
Half-Moon in 1707, and became the publisher of many important books, 
such as Isaac Littlebury's translation of Herodotus in 1708, Dr. William King's 
Miscellanies, 1709, Thoresby's Ducatus Leodiensis, 1717, and Bibliotheca 
Biblica, 1717. With Samuel Keble he was appointed printer of the Votes 
of the House of Commons. He died August 23rd, 1719, when W. and John 
Innys stated at the end of a catalogue of their publications that they had 
secured most of the books printed by Mr. Henry Qements " lately deceased ".

Mercer's Chapel, 1708-16. Succeeded E. Jaye at the former address in 1708, 
when he published A Persuasive to Moderation. [T.C. iii. 588.] In the following 
year with several other booksellers he issued in monthly parts A New Collection 
of Voyages and Travels. About 17 10 he entered into partnership with D. Jack- 
son, and together they took over the Bible and Three Crowns in Cheapside 
near Mercer's Chapel, formerly held by Thomas Parkhurst. Both the partners

seem to have died or given up business by 1716, as the finn was then S. Clifif 
and T. Cox, and in 17 18, R, Cruttenden and T. Cox. 

CLIFTON (FRANCIS), printer in London, Old Bailey, c. 1720, Printer for the 
Roman Catholics. His trade consisted largely in printing ballads and broad- 
sides that were obnoxious to the Government. Thomas Gent, the York

trouble. [Gent, Lije ; Da vies. History of the York Pres5i\ 

COCKERAINE (william), see Cockram. 

COCKERILL, or COCKRIL (thomas), bookseller in London, (i) Atlas in Corn- 
hill ; (2) Three Legs in the Poultry. 1674-1702. Dealt chiefly in theological 
and educational works. His first and last entries in the Term Catalogues 
were in 1674 and 1702. [T.C. i. 176, ill. 289.] Dunton [p. 214] says of him : 
" He was always up to the ears among great persons and business (perhaps 
engaging for a third volume) yet I will do my rival that justice to say he was 
a very religious charitable man. The printing The Morning Exercise and 
Charnott's Works brought him into great credit. . . . His kinsman Mr. Thomas 
Cockril (q. v.) is a living transcript of his uncle's virtues and public spirit ". 

COCKERILL, or COCKRIL (thomas), jun., bookseller in London (?) 1702 ?- 
1705 ?. Nephew of Thomas Cockerill, sen., whom he survived. See Dunton's 
account of the latter, written in 1703. The attribution to him as well as to 
his uncle of some books of 1690 in the Index to T.C. appears to be an error. 
[T.C. III. 3,705.] 

COCKRAM (WILLIAM), bookseller in Northampton, 1675-7. Published The 
State of Northampton Jrom the beginning of the Fire, September 20, 16"]^ to

COGGAN (francis), bookseller in London, Inner-Temple-Lane, 1699-1707. 
First mentioned in the Term Catalogues in June 1699, as a publisher of law 
books. [T.C. III. 137.] Dunton [p. 226] says of him, " He is so cautious and 
wise that he is noted for it . . . and is as well a judge as a seller of books." 
In 1707 Bernard Lintot bought of him one half of Love and a Bottle, for 
£2 35. He was also the publisher of the second part of V. Bowater's Anti- 
quities of Middlesex [Harl. 5961, 128]. He died some time in 1707, and was

succeeded by his widow Margaret Coggan. Her name appears in the Term 
Catalogues for the last time in 1709. [T.C. in. 644.] 

COGGAN (MARGARET), bookseller in London, Inner Temple Lane, 1708* 
Widow of Francis Coggan. She held a share in Dr. John Harris's Lexicon

COLEBROOKE (john), bookseller in Midhurst, Sussex, 1700. In 1700 he 
sold a Sermon preach'd at the funeral of George Payne, Junior . , ., by the

COLES (FRANCIS), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

COLLEY (JOHN), printer (?) in Oxford, 1676. [Madan, p. 30.] 

COLLIER, or COLLYER (john), printer and bookseller in Nottingham, (i) 
Hen Cross ; (2) at the Sheep Pens. 17 11-25. Mentioned in a list of provincial 
booksellers in Notes and Queries [10 S., vol. v. p. 184], as at work in 17 14 
and by Allnutt as in 171 1. He was the printer of The Nottingham Mercury 
and The Nottingham Post. In 1722 he printed a broadside on the method 
of hiring servants [b.m. 1851. c. 10. (51)], and in 1725 an ed. of Charles 
Cotton's Wonders of the Peak. 

COLLIER, or COLLYER (JOSEPH), bookseller in London, (i) Angel on London 
Bridge, a little below the Gate, or, by the Gate ; (2) (a) Bible, (b) Golden 
Bible [under the Gate] on London Bridge, 1679-1724. Is first met with in 
1679, in partnership with Stephen Foster, at the Angel, when he published 
England's Grievances in times of Popery and a sermon preached in St. George's, 
Southwark, at the funeral of Mrs. Frances Fenn [T.C. i. 366], but shortly 
afterwards Foster moved to the Sun and Bible on London Bridge. Collier 
remained at the Angel till after April 10, 1680, as on that date his name 
and address appeared in an advertisement of Bateman's Scurvy-Grass in 
Smith's Currant Intelligence ; but in Michaelmas of that year he is found 
at the Bible [T.C. i. 421], where he remained until 1700. [T.C. i. 217,] The 
house was sometimes called The Golden Bible. Treasurer of the Company

apprentice for many years, . . , He has a great deal of learning, a discerning 
judgement, is pleasant in his conversation, and sincere in his piety. He

writes an excellent hand, is an accurate accomptant and justly merits the 
honour the company of stationers did him, in choosing him their treasurer." 

COLLINS (ARTHUR) J bookseller in London, Black Boy in Fleet Street, 1709-16. 
Said to have been born about 1690, but probably earlier ; his father is said 
to have been gentleman usher to Queen Catherine of Braganza. Collins is 
first found as a bookseller in partnership with Abel Roper. He is chiefly 
remembered as the compiler and publisher of the Peerage called after his name. 
The first edition appeared in 1709, without the compiler's name, but printed 
for Abel Roper and Arthur Collins. This was a volume of 470 pages, but so 
great was its success that a revised and enlarged second edition appeared in 
17 lo-i I, and a third, sold by Arthur Collins alone, in 17 14-16. In expectation 
of a place under Government, Collins gave up his business in Fleet Street in 
1 7 16, but he continued to compile genealogical works, though often " reduced 
to great straits " for money. At length the king granted him a pension of 
£400 a year. Collins died in March 1760 and was buried in Battersea Church 
" aged 70 " ; if this is correct he published his Peerage at the age of 19. 

COLLINS (freeman), printer in London and Norwich ; Norwich, Red Well. 
1682-1713. In 1682 he printed for T. Benskin, London, and C. Yeo, Exon., 
A True and Impartial Relation of the Informations against Three Witches, 
viz. Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and Susanna Edwards, who were . . . 
convicted at . . . Exon. [Haz. i. 127.] Between that date and 1697 he printed 
other books for Exeter booksellers. [J. I, Dredge, Devon Booksellers and 
Printers, pp. 9, 10.] Dunton says [p. 244] that in 1689, he employed Deputy 
Collins to print for him. But his name does not appear in the Term Catalogues 
as a printer until 1703, when he printed for J. Nutt Sir H. Mackworth's 
pamphlet on Conformity [T.C. ill. 373], and in the next year he is found 
printing for Francis Oliver, bookseller in Norwich, the Rev. Thomas Clayton's 
sermon on Unity of Worship. [T.C. iii. 391.] In 1707 he was elected junior 
warden of the Stationers' Company. At this time one of his apprentices was 
Edward Cave, afterwards the founder of The Gentleman's Magazine, who was 
sent down to Norwich to edit The Norwich Courant. Later Collins seems to 
have gone to Norwich himself, and in 17 12, to have set up in succession to 
F. Burgess. His widow Susanna printed till 1724. 

COLLINS (GABRIEL), bookseller in Xondon, at the Middle Temple Gate, 1687-

In i68i he had a shop under the Temple Church. 

COLLINS (THOMAS). See Dictionary, 1641-67. Still in business in 1682. At 
the end of John Burbury's Relation of a Journey of . . . Lord Henry Howard,

covering every class of Hterature. [b.m. 978. b. i.] 

COLMAR (JOHN), printer in Edinburgh, in the Grassmarket at the foot of 
Heriot's Bridge, 1680-5. One of the Dutch workmen brought over by John 
Cairns about 1680. In 1685 he printed Edinburgh's true Almanack, on his

and general literature. He was still publishing in 171 1. 

CONNIBER (JOHN), printer (? or bookseller) in Barnstaple, co. Devon, 1682. 
Mr. Dredge inserts this name in his second supplement on the strength of a 
note made by Mr. J. R. Chanter, who, he thinks, may have met with it in 
the Corporation Accounts. [Dredge, Devon Booksellers and Printers, second 
supplement, p. 59.] 



8o CONYERS— COOPER. 

CONYERS (GEORGE), bookseller in London, (i) Golden Ring, Ludgate Hill; 
(2) Little Britain, (a) over against the Sugar Loaf, {b) next the Feathers. 
1686-1712. This bookseller had a unique stock, hardly to be found in any 
other shop in London, for he made a speciality of the publication of cheap 
practical manuals on every conceivable subject. A glance through the Term 
Catalogues, of which he availed himself largely, shows him as publisher of 
books on angling, astrology, building, cookery, drawing, dyeing, gardening, 
gauging, husbandry, japanning and varnishing, medicine, painting, and 
perfumery. He also published chap-book abridgements of popular romances, 
roadbooks, almanacks, &c. In 1713 he contributed to the fund for the relief 
of William Bowyer, sen. [Timperley, p. 600.] Dunton [p. 230] describes 
Conyers as a " man free from faction, noise, and anger, a diligent man in his 
shop, a kind neighbour, and a religious master ". 

CONYERS (joshua), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

COOK or COOKE (JOHN), bookseller in Sherborne, Dorset, 1 713-16. PubUsher

Life and Character of Mrs. Mary Moders. . . . the Famous German Princess, 
n. d. [Haz. ill. 30.] 

COOKE (WILLIAM), printer in Chester, i7i8(?)-23. Hazlitt records two books 
printed by him. (i) Syntax. The Grounds of the Latin Syntax . . . Chester :

[1720 ?] (2) A Paraphrase on the xxviij Chapter of Deuteronomy. By the Rev. 
McLindsay. Chester : Printed by Wm. Cooke, for the author, 1723. [Haz. i. 
415, 492.] He bought Ince's material in or about 1718. [Gent, pp. 83-4.] 

COOPER (WILLIAM), bookseller and book-auctioneer in London, (i) Warwick 
Lane ; (2) The Pelican, Little Britain, 1668-88. In a volume of astrological 
tracts called The Philosophical Epitaph of W. C, Esquire, 1673, i^ appears 



CORBET— CORBETT. 81 

that at an early period of his life William Cooper was a religious enthusiast and 
a great believer in astrology, and that he either suffered from some physical 
illness, or that his religious beliefs got him into trouble with the authorities. 
In the dedication to the Epitaph he speaks of having been " in a living grave" 
in 1652, and having been "helped from his long troubles" by Elias Ashmole 
in 1662. His first entry in the Stationers' Register was made on January ist, 
1667 [i. e. i66g] and was an astrological tract called A ChymicaU dispensa- 
torie, or, the Treasurie of medicines, written in Latine by John Schroder and 
Englished by William Rowland. {Stat. Reg., Roxb. II. 383.] To his Epitaph 
he added "A Catalogue of Chemical Books" to which in 1675 he made several 
additions ; this was the first English bibliography of the subject. Cooper 
was also the first book-auctioneer in England. His first auction was held 
in 1676, the library dispersed being that of Dr. Seaman. From that time 
until his death he shared with Edward Millington the foremost place as an 
auctioneer, amongst the more important libraries that came under his 
hammer being those of Dr. Samuel Brooke, 1680, Dr. Nathan Paget, M.D., 
i68i, Walter Rea, 1682, and the stock of Richard Davis, bookseller of Oxford, 
between 1686 and 1688. Amongst Cooper's publications may be noted 
Spenser's View of the state of Ireland, Ware's De Scriptoribus Hiberniae, 
Usher's Sylloge veterum Epistolarum Hibernicarum, an edition of Head's 
English Rogue, and Marlowe's Lusfs Dominion. Cooper died before Nov. 1689, 
being succeeded by his widow. [Lawler, p. xxvii.] 

CORBET (cHARLEs), bookseller in London, Oxford Arms in Warwick Lane, 
1683. Does not appear to have been a member of the Company of Stationers, 
as its records show no sign of his having been an apprentice or taking up his 
freedom ; but he may have been a member of some other company. In 
1683 he published a poetical broadside entitled A New Narrative of the Old 
Plot [b.m. 1872. a. I (125*) ], and in the severe winter of 1683-4 he published 
two ballads in commemoration of the frost. In the Term Catalogue for Trin. 
1683, in company with J. Crowch, he advertised A Collection of New Songs set 
within the compass of the Flute. Written and composed by C. F. Gent. [T.C. II. 30.] 
It seems possible that he was a dealer in music rather than in books. 

CORBET (THOMAS), printer (?) at Oxford, 1694. [Madan, p. 32.] 

CORBETT (benjamin), bookseller in London, 1686-1701. Son of Waites or

He was the publisher of the first review entitled Weekly Memorials, or 
Account of Books, 1688, also of Tooker's Fatnous Collection oj Papers \c. 1700.] 
On November 20th, 1701, a Benjamin Corbett who may or may not be 
identical with the above, wrote to a Mr. Pettiver, saying that he was on 
the point of sailing for China. [Sloane MS. 4063, f. 128.] 

CORBETT (thomas), bookseller and book-auctioneer in London, (i) corner of

near Bridewell Bridge ; (b) by Fleet Ditch ; (3) Addison's Head, next the 
Rose Tavern, without Temple Bar. 1715-43. Apparently son of Charles 
Corbet of the Oxford Arms. Thomas Corbett's name does not appear in the 
records of the Stationers' Company either as apprentice or freeman. In 1705 
he published the fourth edition ' with additions, on a fine paper and Elzevir 
letter", of New Miscellaneous Poems. [Postman, Sept. 6th-8th, 17 15.] In 
the same year he also published a sermon called Great Britain's Happiness 
under . . , a Protestant King, by Gershom Rawlins. [b.M. 4474. d. 99.] In 
1 7 16 he began selling books by auction at his warehouse, the Child's Coat, 
down the Ditch side, near Bridewell Bridge. Here on Nov. 7th, 1716, he sold 
the library of Thomas Cooke of Fulham, and on October 31st, 1717, the 
library of the Rev. - Kirke of Chester. [Daily Courant, Oct. 29th, 1717.] 
In 1 7 19 he moved to the Addison's Head without Temple Bar, where he 
continued until his death in 1743. Sir Charles Corbett, the famous lottery 
agent and bookseller, is believed to have been his son. 

CORSELEY (w.), bookseller in Bristol, 1721-35. His name is found in the 
imprint to a sermon of 1721 by J. Harcourt. [b.m. 226. f. i (8).] The dates

COTTRELL (JAMES), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

COURTENAY (james), bookseller in London, Golden Horseshoe, Saffron Hill, 
1671-85. The earliest notice of him is found in the State Papers in the form 
of a news letter addressed to him from Whitehall, during his absence abroad 
in 167 1. It deals solely with foreign affairs and has no reference to his 
business. [Calendar of State Papers, Charles II, 1671, pp. 332, &c.] In 1679 
he published Female Poems on several occasions, written by Ephelia, which 
was printed for him by WilUam Downing. [T.C. i. 350.] In 1685 Courtenay 
sued Thomas Young " bibliopolam ", of Shaftesbury, for the balance of his 
account £30 6s. [C.P.R., Hil. i Jas. II, Roll 3041, m. 272 v.] 

COURTNEY (JOHN), bookseller in Salisbury, 1650-75. See Dictionary, 1641-67.

COWNLY (gh,bert), bookseller in London, at the Pope's Head in the Lower 
Walk (or East end of the Lower Walk) of the New Exchange, 1685-91. 
Succeeded William Cademan at this house in 1685. [T.C. 11. 129.] Cownly 
published for the Rev. R. Wolley, The Present State of France, 1689 [Haz. 
hi! 270.] The unsold copies were reissued in 1691, with a new title-page, 
Galliae Notitia, or the present state of France. On the verso of the last leaf of 
a copy of this edition in the B.M. is a list of Cownly's publications, including 
Miscellany Poems, with the Temple of Death, by Eminent Hands, and Segrais' 
romance, Zayde. The latter he apparently took over from Cademan, as 
Mr. Esdaile notes a copy with the latter's imprint, published in 1678 ; but 
he does not record any issue by Cownly, who may merely have bought some 
of the stock of F. Saunders's second edition, 1690. [Esdaile, p. 304.] About 
1690 J. Knight is found in possession of Cownly's premises, but not before ; 
and all the references given in the index to the second volume of the Term 
Catalogues to Knight as at this address should refer to the Blue Anchor in

COWPER. See Cooper, 

COWSE (benjamin), bookseller in London, Rose and Crown, St. Paul's Church- 
yard, 1714-23. In 1 7 14 Humphrey Wanley approached Cowse and others 
with a proposal that they should publish Annates de Lanercost, Viscount 
Weymouth having promised his support ; but the Viscount died suddenly 
and the project fell through. In 1 72 1 he published Laws of British Plantations. 
[Haz. A. 261.] Cowse is next heard of in 1723, in connexion with the publi- 
cation of certain castrated sheets of Holinshed's Chronicle, which was adver- 
tised in the Post Boy of February i6th, 1723. In this he was associated

Recreation, 1673. It went through many editions. Cox was also the publisher 
of some plays and historical works. In 1680 he published a catalogue of plays 
reprinted and brought up to date from that printed in Nicomede, 1671. 
[Wood, I. 20.] In 1685 he appears to have had a shop at Oxford, which 
Mr. Arber says was near Queen's College. From there he published A. Freyer's 
Funeral Sermon on the death of Charles II, preached at Dort, 1685, and Gerard 
Langbaine's Momus Triumphans, 1688. [T.C. 11. 143, 240.] 

COX (THOMAS ?), bookseller in London, Bible and Three Crowns, near Mercers' 
Chappel in Cheapside, 17 16-18. In partnership with S. Cliff, and afterwards 
R. Cruttenden (g. v.). He may be the Thomas Cox referred to by Timperley 
[p. 684] as an eminent bookseller and exchange broker, who died on Feb- 
ruary 3rd, 1754. 

CRAWFURD (thomas), printer in Glasgow, 1721. In 1721 he printed an 
edition of Naphthali, or the Wrestlings of the Church of Scotland. [John McUre,

year he moved to Lombard Street, and published there a pamphlet on schism 
and separation. [T.C. i. 319.] Nothing more is heard of him. 

CROOK (ANDREW), bookseller and King's Printer in Ireland, Dublin, 1681-1731. 
Son of John Crook (1638-69). In 1681 he was in partnership with his mother 
Mary Crook {q. v.) as a bookseller. In 1685 he took to printing, in partnership 
with Samuel Helsham. In 1686 he became B. Tooke's assign in the oflfice of 
King's Printer, and after 1689 was sole King's Printer. He worked till 1731, 
and died in or about 1732 ; his will was deposited in the Dublin Prerog.Court. 

CROOK (JOHN), jun., printer in Dublin, 1679-84. Son of John Crook, sen. 
(Q.v. Dictionary, 1641-67), King's Printer in Dublin, who died in 1669. 
Apparently he was not old enough or qualified to get his father's place, and 
it was filled by B. Tooke, from 1669 to 1678 alone, but in 1679 John Crook 
shared the office of King's Printer with him and so continued till 1683. He 
died intestate in 1684. Administration was granted to his mother, Mary 
(or Maria) Crook, widow. 

CROOK (mary), printer in Dublin, 1671-84. Widow of John Crook, sen., 
King's Printer in Dublin, and mother of John Crook, jun. She was 
a bookseller in 167 1 and also appears as a printer a little later. Her 
place of business in 1679 was His Majesty's Printing House, and she sold 
works printed by Tooke, and also by him and her son John when he was 
Tooke's partner in the office. Her son Andrew joined her in the bookselling 
business in 1681.

Herts. N. & Q. ill. 13.] In Hil. 1695 she published a sermon by Thomas 
Manningham [T.C. 11. 537.] In 1696 the firm apparently ceased business, and 
its stock was remaindered ; as in Hil. 1696 a notice appeared in the Term 
Catalogue that " all the books printed for William Crook at the Green Dragon " 
were to be sold by D. Brown at the Black Swan and Bible without Temple 
Bar [T.C, ii. 575.] 



CROOKE— CROSKILL. 87

CROOM (GEORGE), printer in London, (i) Bride Lane ; (2) Blue Ball in Thames 
Street, near Addle Hill (over against, or near, Baynards Castle) ; (3) Blue 
Ball over against Bridewell ; (4) On the Thames. 1671-1707. In 1670 or 
1 67 1 a private press was discovered by the Company of Stationers at the 
house of George Croom in Bride Lane ; who, being sent for, acknowledged 
the having a press in his house for printing damask boards. The Company 
ordered that the press should be taken down and brought to the Hall. 
[MS. records of Stat. Co.] Nothing more is heard of him until 1682, when he 
printed The Loyal London Mercury (24 nos., June i4th-November nth). 
[Timperley, p. 563.] Croom's name appears twice only in the Term Catalogues, 
first as the printer of The Tryals of Henry Cornish [and others], 1685 [T.C. 
II. 150], and 2nd ed. 1707 ; and in 1689, of a Manual of Prayers [T.C. 11. 284]. 
On May 9th, i688 he issued the first number of The Weekly Test Paper. 
[Timperley, p. 571,] Dunton [p. 252] says of him : " Some would insinuate 
as though he favoured the Jacobites, but I take him for a man of more sense. 
. . . Mr. Croom is a fair dealer, understands his business. . . . He . . . formerly 
printed for me The Tigurine Liturgy and of late several sheets of the Post 
Angel." During the great frost of 1683-4 Croom set up a printing press on the 
ice on the Thames, at which he printed a broadside entitled, Thamasis's [sic\ 
Advice to the Painter from her Frigid Zone, or, Wonders upon the water. [b.M,

daughter of Harry Gutteridge of Leyton. In a " Chronological Account of 
Remarkable Accidents and Occurrences to date ", given in Francis Burges's 
True Description of the City of Norwich, ed. 1718, occurs this note : " 1706, 
Sam. Hasbart a distiller, set up a Printing Office in Magdalen St. and 
sent for Henry Crossgrove from London to be his journeyman." They 
separated in 1718, according to Gent. The first number of the 
Norwich Gazette was printed by Crossgrove in November 1706. In politics 
it was a Tory and Jacobite paper. [Timperley, p. 626.] In the Weekly 
Journal for March 12th, 17^^, was inserted a paragraph to the effect that a 
petition had been signed by the Whigs, calling upon the Government to 
indict "Mr. Crossgrove the printer" for publishing in the Gazette "A Short 
Account of the State of England, when King James II intended to call 
his second parliament " taken from Rennet's History of England, " but we do 
not hear that the said printer is sent for in custody, or that he keeps out of the 
way for the same, it having been only reprinted by him after it had sold above 
10 impressions in London ". Crossgrove had some correspondence with 
Strype. In his later years he became Town Councillor for Mancroft Ward. 
He died on November 12th, 1744. 

CROUCH, or CROWCH (edward), printer in London, 1672. See Dictionary, 
1641-67. Still at work in 1675, when he is mentioned in a list of printing 
houses in London. [S. P. Dom. Car. 11. vol. 369 (97.)] 

CROUCH (NATHANIEL), sen., bookseller in London, (i) Bell, next to Kemp's 
Coffee House in Exchange Alley (over against the Royal Exchange in Corn- 
hill), 1681-2 ; (2) Bell (a) in the Poultry, near Cheapside, (b) over against 



CROUCH. 89 

Grocers' Alley, in the Poultry, near Cheapside, 1683-1708. i663-i725(?). 
Was bom about 1632 ; son of a tailor at Lewes. Apprenticed on May 5th, 1656, 
to Livewell Chapman for seven years, and then took up his freedom in the 
Company of Stationers. Under the pseudonym of Richard or Robert Burton, 
he compiled a number of small books of which Dr. Johnson said that " they 
seem very proper to allure backward readers ". The History of the Nine 
Worthies of the World, 1696, &c., is perhaps the most celebrated. Dunton 
[pp. 206, 435-6] says of him, " I think I have given you the very soul of his 
character when I have told you that his talent lies at Collection. He has 
melted down the best of our English Histories into Twelve penny Books, 
which are filled with wonders, rarities, and curiosities ; for, you must know, 
his Title-pages are a little swelling ". The D.N.B. gives a list of forty-six of 
his compilations. He is believed to have died before 1725, when the name of 
Thomas Crouch (perhaps his son) is found on one of his books. [D.N.B.] 

CROUCH (NATHANIEL), jun., bookseller in London, Bell, Poultry, 1697. Pro- 
bably a son of Nathaniel Crouch, sen., at whose shop he published, with 
T. Crouch, a divinity book in 1697. [T.C. ill. 2.] 

CROUCH (SAMUEL), bookseller in London, at the Prince's Arms, a comer shop 
of Pope's Head Alley in Cornhill, 1674-17 11. Was in some way related to 
Nathaniel Crouch (q. v.) Samuel made his first entry in the Term Catalogue 
in Mich. 1674 [T.C. 1. 187], and became a publisher of school books and cheap 
literature. In 1679 he started a newspaper called The True Protestant 
Domestic Intelligence. No. i was issued on July 9th, 1679. Mr. Arber says 
that Nathaniel Crouch was the writer of it. [T.C. i. 543.] In 1691 Samuel 
Crouch became surety in ;ti,ooo for a certain John Gardner, in an action 
brought against the latter for assault. [C.P.R. Mich. 3 W. and M. Roll, 3101 m. 
140 recto.] His name occurs frequently in the Term Catalogues up to 1711. 
Dunton says of him [p. 211], " He is just and punctual in all his deaUngs : 
never speaks ill of any man ; has a swinging soul of his own ; would part with 
all he has to serve a Friend ; and that's enough for one Bookseller ". 

CROUCH (THOMAS), bookseller in London, (i) Bell in the Poultry, 1697 ; (2) 
Bell in Patemoster Row, near Cheapside, 1725. 1697-1725 ? Probably a son 
of Nathaniel Crouch the elder, at whose shop (above) he published, with 
N. Crouch jun., a divinity book in 1697 [T.C. iii. 2.] In 1725 his name is 
found on one of " R. Burton's " booklets. 



90 CROWCH— CROWNFIELD. 

CROWCH (j.), music-seller in London, Three Lutes in Drury Lane, 1683-6^ 
With C. Corbet he published in 1683, A Collection of new Songs, for the flute, 
by C. F,, and in 1686 with N, Thompson The Cojnpleat Dancing-Master. 
[T.C. II. 30, 168.] 

CROWNFIELD (Cornelius), printer to the University and bookseller at 
Cambridge, 1 698-1 743. " A Dutchman, who had been a soldier, and a very 
ingenious man " [Ames, p. 462]. He was appointed business adviser to the 
Curators of the University Press in 1698 at the first meeting of that newly 
formed body, and seems to have been at once sent to Rotterdam to buy type 
for the University Press. He often visited Holland on business, and there 
are several references to him in the Correspondence of Dr. Richard Bentley, 
and in Hearne's Collections. In a letter from Dr. Barnes to Heame, May 15th, 
1709, " Landlord Crownfield has brought back the frontispiece [to Homer, 
printed 1711] rarely designed, from Holland". [T. Hesirne, Re7narks and 
Collections, ed. Doble, II. 198.] He was appointed Printer to the University 
February nth, 170I, but previous to this we find printed for him, A.Tacquet, 
Elementa Geometriae, cura Qui. Whiston, 1703. From the time of his appoint- 
ment to 1740, when he was succeeded by Joseph Bentham, a large number of 
important works were printed by him, amongst which may be mentioned. 
Dr. Bentley's editions of Horace (1711) and Terence (1726), the second edition 
of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (17 13), 
Wasse's edition of Sallust (i 7 10), Sir Thomas Browne's Christian Morals (i 716), 
Historiae Ecclesiasticae, 3 vols., folio (1720), Dr. Knight's Life of Erasmus 
(1726), Conyers Middleton's Bibliothecae Cantabrigiensis ordinandae methodus 
(1723) and his Dissertation concerning the Origin of Printing in England (1735), 
some being beautifully printed with the new type purchased from Holland, 
on paper specially purchased from the same source [see a note to Newton's 
Principia in Gray's Newton Bibliography, p. 7.] On February 25th, i7|q, 
a resolution was passed to appoint a new inspector, and to allow the present, 
now infirm, to continue his full salary, and on March 24th, 1740, Joseph 
Bentham was appointed in the room of Crownfield [Bowes, Cambridge Printers, 
313]. Crownfield died in 1743 and was buried in St. Botolph's parish on 
November 4th. His wife Mary had died in 1733. Several children are 
recorded in the parish registers. Two of his sons, Henry and Thomas, were 
educated at Clare College, and were subsequently ordained. Previous to his 
appointment as University Printer he lived in St. Edward's parish, but on his

« 
appointment moved to the house attached to the University Press in Silver 
Street. Dr. Barnes, writing to Heame c. September 24, 1708, says that he is 
lodging with Mr. Crownfield at the Printing House [Heame, Remarks and 
Collections, il. 135.] He was a bookseller as well as a printer ; Tacquet was 
printed for him in 1704 and later in various works printed by him he has a list 
of " Books Printed for and Sold by Cornelius Crownfield at the University 
Press in Cambridge ". 

CRUMP (JOHN), bookseller in London, Three Bibles, St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1673-82. Began to publish in 1673 [T.C. 1. 149.] In 1675 he published a novel 
entitled Beraldus, Prince of Savoy, [b.m. 12510. aaa. 3.] The last entry under 
his name occurs in Mich. 1682, when he published a political pamphlet called, 
The True Loyalist. [T.C. I. 503.] 

CRUTTENDEN (henry), printer at Oxford, 1681-94. Anthony Wood had 
a Catalogue of books on sale by John Gellibrand of London dated i682(?) 
which was given to him by Cruttenden the printer on the occasion of the 
execution of Stephen CoUedge at Oxford on August 31st, 1681 . [Wood, II. 553.] 
In 1684 he was threatened with proceedings for printing an edition of 
Cornelius Nepos, which Dr. Timothy Halton the licenser declared con- 
tained more than he had licensed. [lb., III. 86.] In 1687 Obadiah Walker, 
Master of University College, set up a Roman Catholic press in his house, 
aided by Cruttenden, who obtained the title of King's printer. [Madan, 
p. 19.] Cruttenden died in 1694, and Wood notes that he was buried m 
Holiwell Churchyard on October 12th. [Wood, in. 470.] 

CRUTTENDEN (r.), bookseller in London, Bible and Three Crowns near 
Mercers' Chappel in Cheapside, 1718. Perhaps a son or brother of Henry 
Cruttenden (q. v.). In partnership with T. Cox, in which he appears to have 
succeeded S. Cliff (q. v.). 

CULLEN (JOHN) stationer in London, The Buck without Temple Bar, 17 10. 
The shop was bequeathed by Mary Hayes in her will, dated 1710 and proved 
17 13, and is described as being "heretofore in the occupation of Ephraim 
Dockwra bookseller deed . . . and now in the occupation of John CuUen 
citizen and stationer of London ", and as having formerly been known as the 
Pestle and Mortar. The house with this latter sign was occupied in 1694 by 
Andrew Bell and Jonas Luntley {q.7>.). [P.C.C. 136 Leeds.] 



92 CUMBERLAND— CURLL. 

CUMBERLAND (richard), bookseller in London, Angel in St. Paul's Church- 
yard, 1693-8. Mathematical and miscellaneous publisher. His first and last 
entries in the Term Catalogues were in Easter 1693, and Mich. 1698. [T.C. II. 
458 ; III. loi.] 

CUNYNGHAM (alex.), printer in Glasgow, before 1681. His will was registered 
February 25th, 1681. [Aldis, p. 112,] 

CURLL (EDMUND), bookseller in London and Tunbridge Wells, (i) Co vent 
Garden ; (2) Peacock without Temple Bar, 1706-10 ; (3) (a) Dial and Bible, 
against St. Dunstan's Church, {b) next the Temple Coffee House in Fleet 
Street, 1710-23 ; (4) on the Walk, Tunbridge Wells, 1712 ; (5) Paternoster 
Row, 1720 [this and the preceding must be branch shops] ; (6) over against 
Catherine Street in the Strand, 1723-6 ; (7) next to Wills's Coffee House in 
Bow Street, Covent Garden, 1729; (8) Burleigh Street, Strand, 1733; 
(9) Pope's Head, Rose Street, Covent Garden, 1735-47. 1705 (?)-47. Bom, 
according to his own statement [Curliad, p. 14] in 1683, but perhaps in 1675, 
as the Gentleman's Magazine [xvil. 592] gives his age as seventy-two at his 
death in 1747. Curll came early from the West of England to London, and 
was apprenticed to a bookseller, "Mr. Smith by Exeter Change". Having 
served his apprenticeship he set up first a stall and then a shop in Covent 
Garden, where he probably carried on a purely retail trade. In 1706 he first 
appears in an imprint, pubUshing at " the Peacock, near St. Clement's Church 
in the Strand ", a " reprint " [D.N.B.], really a reissue of the sheets, of 
Captain Bladen's translation of Caesar's Commentaries, published in the 
previous year by Richard Smith, who may be identified with his old master. 
In 1707 he pirated Prior's Poems on Several Occasions. In 1708 he published, 
in conjunction with E. Sanger, Dodwell's Explication . . . concerning the Immor- 
tality of Human Souls, and Boileau's Lutrin. [T.C. III. 595-6.] The latter 
appears in his list of 1735 as still in stock. Curll declared in 1727 that the 
former was the first book printed by (i. e. for) him. [Apology for the Writings 
of Walter Moyle.] On September 13th, 17 10, he made the first of his very 
few entries in Stat. Reg., Some Account of the Family of Sacheverell, and he 
himself contributed to the controversy a pamphlet. The Case of Dr. Sacheverell, 
1710. In this year he left the Peacock for the Dial and Bible close by, pre- 
viously occupied by A. Boswill, and published there A Complete Key to the 
Tale of a Tub. Two years later he is found subscribing a guinea to the Bowyer 



CURLL. 93 

fund, and had prospered enough to have a branch shop at Tunbridge Wells. 
In 1 716 began his long quarrel with Pope. He had had a hand in the publica- 
tion by James Roberts of Court Poents, some of which are attributed in the 
advertisement to " the laudable translator of Homer ". Pope was so annoyed 
that he arranged a meeting with Curll and IJntot at the Swan Tavern in 
Fleet Street, and there administered to Curll an " emetic potion " ; he then 
published a satirical account of the affair, A Full and True Account of a Horrid 
and Barbarous Revenge by Poison on the Body of Mr. Edmund Curll bookseller, 
which was followed by other pamphlets. In the same year Curll first came 
under the displeasure of authority, being reprimanded at the bar of the 
House of Lords for breach of privilege in publishing a piratical edition of 
An Account of the Trial of the Earl of Wintoun [Lords' Journals, May 17 16], 
and was also tossed in a blanket and beaten by the Westminster scholars 
for pirating, with many inaccuracies, their Captain's oration over Dr. South. 
In 1720 he apparently opened a branch shop in the City, in Paternoster Row, 
but continued to give the Dial and Bible as his address on imprints till at 
least 1723. In 1721 he was again convicted at the bar of the House of Lords, 
for an unauthorized edition of the Duke of Buckingham's Life and Works ; 
and in 1725 and 1728 he was fined for publishing immoral books ; on the 
latter occasion he was also imprisoned for five months, and used his imprison- 
ment to acquire the copy of the Memoirs of John Ker of Kersland, for publish- 
ing which (as being defamatory of the Government) he was in the same year 
condemned to stand in the pillory at Charing Cross ; the inconveniences of 
this he skilfully avoided by circulating among the crowd a leaflet stating 
that he was suffering for vindicating the memory of Queen Anne. He stated 
that of the most notorious of the indecent books he had been convicted of 
publishing in 1728 {Venus in tJte Cloister) he had sold only one chance copy ; 
but this can hardly be true, as it appears, with the rest, in his list of 1735. 
In spite of all these transactions he is found in 1723-4 and again in 1728 
offering his services to the Government. In 1733 his Copy of the Will of 
Matthew Tindal, one of a large series of wills and memoirs which led Arbuthnot 
to observe to Swift that Curll was " one of the new terrors of death ", brought 
him into a violent quarrel with Eustace Budgell. His feud with Pope had 
continued intermittently since 1716. In 1726 he printed Pope's Letters to 
Henry Cromwell, of 1708-12, and Pope accused him in the Dunciad (Notes, 
ed. 1729) of, among many other things, clandestinely acquiring the copy 



94 CURLL. 

of these letters, a charge which Curll denied. But Pope's attack at large on 
Curll in the Dunciad is so strong that its victim is now generally remembered 
only as " dauntless Curll " and " shameless Curll ". He replied at length in 
the Curliady 1729, a valuable source of biographical details concerning its 
author. In spite of these amenities Pope is known to have secretly arranged 
the publication by Curll in 1735 of his Literary Correspondence for Thirty Years, 
and at the same time to have contrived to have the publication stayed by 
the Lords on a far-fetched and unsuccessful plea of breach of privilege. 
His object was to give excuse for and advertise his own authorized edition. 
Curll published his collection, which degenerated into a miscellany, in 1735-7, 
and Pope his in 1737-41. Curll had simultaneously moved to Rose Street, 
Covent Garden, and taken the sign of " Pope's Head ", of which sign his 
device is no doubt a copy. Here he continued to publish, apparently more 
peacefully, until 1747, on December nth of which year he died. His will, 
which was proved on July 21st, 1748, contains the following codicil of 
July 17th, 1742 : 

I have no relatives, my son is dead. 

He left no issue, and his wife 's re-wed ; 

Therefore no legacys at all I leave. 

But all I've got to my dear wife bequeathe. 

[P.C.C. 209 Strahan.] 

The son here referred to as dead by 1742 had a separate shop in 1726 and 
sold his father's books, while the latter was in conflict with the authorities ; 
he appears to have been with him in Burleigh Street in 1733. Curll issued 
brief select lists of novels and of poems in 17 19 [in The Female Deserters 
(printed for James Roberts), and Major Pack's Miscellanies^ and of theology 
in 1723 [in Addison's Miscellanies], also a list of forty-three books issued 
from " over against Catherine Street in the Strand ", i.e. not before 1723 
[a copy is bound after John Hales's Discourse, 1720, b.m. 1113. g. 13]. 
Classified general lists appeared in 1726 [in Ashmole's Order oj the Garter, 2nd 
ed., not in b.m.], and in 1735 [separately, B.M. G. 13457/2]. This last con- 
tains nearly two hundred items, including not only some of his earliest 
publications, but also those on account of which he had suffered fines and 
imprisonment, and is the basis of any bibliography of his productions. It 
may be compendiously said of Curll that while he possessed all the vices 



CURTEYNE— CURTIS. 95 

attributed to him, he also possessed virtues which are too commonly ignored. 
Some of his publications are in the worst style of a bad period ; many are 
libellous. He was pertinaciously defiant of authority, and malicious toward 
his enemies. But he is generally truthful, and his chief enemy, Pope, was 
the aggressor and deserved much worse handling than Curll gave him. The 
accusations against him of starving his hacks are apparently exaggerated, at 
least, if not quite false. Curll's classified list of 1735 shows that he was 
a large publisher of almost every sort of literature, especially of memoirs 
and of local history. A series of county histories, which he advertised as 
Anglia lUustrata, in 20 vols., and a bibliography of such books, entitled The 
English Topographer, alone give him a claim to gratitude ; but comparatively 
few of his publications are worthless. In short, he was a man of considerable 
intellect, and an excellent man of business, who was troubled by few scruples. 
A vivid portrait of him is drawn by Amory in John Bunch (ed. 1770, iv, 
138, &c.) : " Curl was in person very tall and thin, an ungainly, awkward, 
whitefaced man. His eyes were a light grey, large, projecting, gogle and 
purblind. He was splay-footed, and baker-kneed. He . . . was well acquainted 
with more than the titlepages of books. ... He was not an infidel. ... He 
was a debauchee. ... By filling his translations with wretched notes, forged 
letters and bad pictures, he raised the price of a four shilling book to ten. . . . 
He died at last as great a penitent ... as ever expired." [W. J. Thoms, 
Curll Papers (reprinted from N. & Q.) ; D.N.B. ; and sources quoted.] 

CURTEYNE (amos), bookseller at Oxford, 1665-90. See Dictionary, 1641-67. 
Son of Henry Curteyne. Was established as a bookseller as early as 1664, 
when Anthony Wood bought books of him. [Life and Times, vols, i, ii.] He 
began to publish in 1670, when he advertised Edward Leigh's Select and 
Choice Observations concerning all the Roman and Greek Emperors, and, in 
partnership with George West and John Crosley, Charles Estienne's Dictiona- 
rium Historicum, Geographicum, Poeticum. [T.C. I. 45, 50, 62.] In 1676 
Curteyne pubhshed Sir Henry Spelman's De non temerandis Ecclesiis. \T.C. 
I. 230.] His name appears in the Term Catalogue for the last time in Easter 
1687, when he advertised Institutio Logicae by John Wallis and a duodecimo 
entitled OJ Education. [T.C. II. 193-195.] He died in 1690. 

CURTIS (jane), bookseller in London, 1679-90. Wife of Langly Curtis 
{q. v.). 



96 CtFRTiS— DAGNEL. 

CURTIS (langLy), bookseller in London, (i) Goat Court, (a) on Ludgate Hill, 
(b) near Fleet Bridge ; (2) Sir Edmonbury Godfrey's Head, near Fleet Bridge. 
1668-90. Apparently all these addresses refer to the same shop. On 
February i6th, i668 [i.e. i66|] he entered The Quaker's SpiritudU Cort [sic] 
proclaynted. [Stat. Reg. Roxb., Ii. 397.] He published several papers in 
support of Gates and Bedloe, and amongst others A Pacqtiet of Advice from 
Route, a weekly sheet the first number of which appeared on Friday, December 
3rd, 1678. He and his wife Jane were frequently in trouble with the authori- 
ties. On February 7th, i6J| Jane Curtis was tried for printing a copy of 
verses reflecting on the Lord Chief Justice entitled Scroggs upon Scroggs, 
and in April 1683, Langly Curtis was ordered to pay £500 and stand in the 
pillory in Bloomsbury Market for publishing Lord Russell's Glwst, or the 
Night Walker of Bloomsbury. {London Gazette, April 21-24, 1683.] In this 
year he also printed an answer to Elkanah Settle's Narrative [Nichols, Lit. 
Anecd., i. 43], after which nothing more is heard of him in the Term Catalogues, 
but Hazlitt traces him until 1690. [Haz. i. 456.] 

CUTLER (ROBERT), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

D. (n.), bookseller (?) in London, Little Britain, 1674. Published a topical 
pamphlet in 1674. [Haz. I. 264.]

and in 1697 S. D. alone printed Miscellanies over Claret. [Haz. iii. 300 ; Huth.] 

D. (w.), bookseller in London. Possibly Walter Davis. These initials are 
found on many ballads and broadsides during the period of the Popish Plot. 

DAGNALL (mathias), bookseller at Aylesbury and Leighton Buzzard, 1658- 
1736. Probably son of Stephen Dagnall. [See Dictionary, 1641-67.] A tablet 
in the Lady Chapel of Aylesbury Church states that he died September 26, 
1736, aged 78. His wife Sarah died in August 1736, aged 76. They left two 
sons, Matthias and Deverell. He dealt very largely in ballads. 

DAGNEL (STEPHEN), bookseller at Chesham, Bucks, 1720. His name is found 
with that of a score of other provincial booksellers and chapmen, in the 



DALTON— DARBY. 97 

imprint to a ballad entitled Roger's Delight ; or the West Country christning 
& gossiping, Northampton, 1720. He was probably son of Stephen Dagnall, 
bookseller of Aylesbury, and brother of Mathias Dagnall {q. v.). 

DALTON (ISAAC), printer and bookseller in London, Goswell Street, 1716-18. 
Published a weekly newspaper, The Shift shifted, of which no. 12 appeared 
on July 2ist, 1716 ; in 1718 he is found printing, for W. Boreham, an edition 
of Skelton's Tunning of Elinor Rumming. 

DANCER (NATHANIEL), bookseller and bookbinder in London, Fleet Street, 
c. 1700. Dunton [p. 228] says of him : " He was formerly a binder, but is 
now a noted bookseller in Fleet-street." His name is not otherwise known, 
and he was probably only a retail dealer. 

DANIEL (M.), bookseller in London, 1671-5 (?), Possibly widow of Thomas 
Daniel. Published in partnership with T. RatclifiE, Madame de Villedieu's 
novel, Love's Journal. [Esdaile, p. 211.] May be the M. D. who published 
The Starr-Prophet Anatomiz'd and Dissected, by J. S., 1675. [Haz. 11. 529.] 

DANIEL (THOMAS), printer in London, 1669-70. Possibly successor to Roger 
Daniel. In company with Thomas RatclifEe he printed for Philip Chetwind 
in 1669 the ninth edition of Earle's Microcosmographie. One T. D., printer, 
who may have been Daniel, was associated with William Downing about 1670. 

DANVERS ( ), stationer in London, Temple Churchyard, 1689. Known 

from an advertisement of stolen books in the London Gazette of May 6th, 1689. 

DARBY (JOHN), sen., printer in London, Bartholomew Close, 1662-1704. 
See Dictionary, 1641-67. In February 1684 he was convicted of printing 
a libel called Lord Russell's Speech ; but escaped with a fine of twenty marks. 
[Nichols, Lit. Anecd., will. 367.] Dunton [p. 247] has this notice of him : 
" I might call him the religious printer. He goes to Heaven with the Ana- 
baptists but is a man of general charity. He printed that excellent speech 
of my Lord Russell and several pieces of Colonel Sydney, and is a true assert or 
of English liberties." Timperley [pp. 589-90] says that he died December nth, 
1704, in his 80th year. He was succeeded by his son John* Among his 
apprentices was Henry Woodfall,

1713 for the relief of William Bowyer after his fire. In 1719 he printed 
for booksellers at Bath, Bristol, and Oxford, Arthur Bedford's Serious Remon- 
strance against the stage. In 1721-2 he printed for D. Browne the 8-vol. 
edition of Rushworth's Historical Collections, He died at Islington in the 
early part of 1733, his will being proved on February 3rd, 1732 [i.e. 1733]. 
He left an only child, Elizabeth, wife of Isaac Clarke, and desired that his 
executors should be cautious how they disposed of any of his copies of books 
or shares of copies, in case any of his grandchildren should become or marry 
a bookseller. 

DARKER ( ), printer in London, c. 1690 (?). Dunton [p. 247] mentions 

" Mr. Darker " as having printed much for him, first in partnership with

DAWKS (ichabod), printer in London, (i) Blackfriars ; (2) Wardrobe Court, 
Great Carter Lane. 1673-1730. Eldest son of Thomas Dawks the younger. 
Bom at Westerham in Kent, September 22nd, 1661 . On May i6th, 1673, he went 
with his father to work at Mrs. Maxwell's printing office, but in the following 
year they transferred their services to Mrs. Flesher. Ichabod Dawks married 
on August 3rd, 1687. In 1694 he petitioned the Court of Assistants of the 
Stationers Company, representing the inconvenience of the' press at Chester, 
and that it was reasonable to suspect that many of the late pamphlets might 
be printed there, there being no one to overlook it. The court agreed that 
a representation be made of it to one of the secretaries of State. [Records of 
the Stat. Co.] He is chiefly remembered as the founder of the newspaper 
known as Dawks' News-Letter, which was distinguished from other papers 
of the time by being printed on writing paper in script type, with a blank 
space left for correspondences. It continued until 17 15, perhaps later ; but 
copies are rare, and complete sets unknown. Dawks was also the printer 
of a sheet called The Protestant Mercury, issued in 1697. His name rarely 
appears in the Term Catalogue. He died February 27th, 1730, and was 
buried at Low Leyton. [D.N.B., Timperley, p. 660 ; Nichols, Lit. Anecd.,

of Thomas Dawks, printer [d. 1670]. Bom at Kelmscott in Oxfordshire, 
October 8th, 1636. Admitted at Merchant Taylors' School, April 2nd, 1649. 
Began as a printer at the private press of the Master, W. Du Card, and from 
1652 to 1657 was employed as a compositor on Walton's Polyglot Bible; he 
afterwards worked at John Darby's printing house in Bartholomew Close. 
He married in December 1660, and his son Ichabod was bom at Westerham, 
Kent, on September 22nd, i66i. On May i6th, 1673, Thomas and his son were 
working in the office of Mrs. Maxwell, from which they went to Mrs. Flesher's 
printing house on October 5th, 1673. Thomas Dawks set up as a master 
printer in Blackfriars in May 1674 ; in Hil. 1680 he and his son printed a 
Methodical History of the Popish Plot. [T.C. 1. 384.] In the previous year, 
however, his address is given as The Blue Anchor at the west end of Paul's 
and also as in Ludgate Street. These evidently refer to one and the same 
house, which was doubtless a warehouse or shop for the sale of books, distinct 
from the printing houses. In the Triie Protestant Mercury of June 22-5, 
1681, he advertised his removal to Thames Street, near Puddle Dock, and 
in 1685 his office was in Addle Hill in Carter Lane. His name occurs for the 
last time in the Term Catalogues in Easter 1689 [T.C. 11. 252], but his entries 
there are few. The date of his death is unknown ; but his name occurs as 
publisher of Dawks' News Letter on August 4th, 1696. His daughter Dorothy 
married first Benjamin Allport and secondly William Bowyer the elder.

To6 DOWNING— DRAPER. 

DOWNING (JOSEPH), printer and bookseller in London, St. Bartholomew's 
Close, 1670-1724. He may have been some relation of William Downing the

in London, issued in 1675, when he is referred to as one who had set up since

the D. of Buckingham's Letter, printed by W. D., 1685, may be from his 
press. In 1690 he reprinted the Dublin Intelligence. At the time of the fire 
at W. Bowyer's premises there were two printers of the name of Downing, 
who contributed to his relief fund [Nichols, Lit. Anecd., i. 62-3.] In 1720 
Edward Ward's Delights of the Bottle was printed by W. Downing at the

DUMBAR or DUNBAR (Andrew), bookseller in Edinburgh, at the Tron-Kirk, 
1684. His name occurs in the imprint to Certanien niathematicum, betwixt 
George LiddeU and James Pater son (Aberdeen. Printed by John Forbes . . . 
and are to be sold by Andrew Dumbar Book-seller at the Tron-Kirk in 
Edinburgh). He is believed to have married the widow of William Jaffray,

DUNCAN (JAMES), printer and type-founder in Glasgow, near Gibson's-Wynd, 
in the Salt-Market Street, 1717-c. 1750. Up to 1720 he printed in partnership 
with William Duncan, but after that date he worked alone. In 1718 he is 
styled a letter-founder, and on October 2nd, 17 19, he was appointed printer 
to the town. [John M'Ure, History of Glasgow, 1830, p. 370.] 

DUNCAN (WILLIAM), printer in Glasgow, in the Salt Market, 171 7- 1. 1760. 
Up to 1720 he printed in partnership with James Duncan, but from that date 
until 1760, or later, he worked alone. [John M'Ure, History of Glasgow, 1830, 
P- 370.] 

DUNLOP (jAMEs), bookseller in Glasgow, 1676-83. James Durham's The Law 
Unsealed, Edinburgh, 1676, was sold by him and other Glasgow booksellers. 
His name occurs among the debtors in the inventory of A. Anderson in 1676. 
The James Dunlope, one of G. Lithgow's debtors in 1662, was probably the 
same. Will registered September 22nd, 1683. [Aldis, p. 112.] 

DUNMORE (JOHN), bookseller in London, near the sign of the Woolpack in 
Ivy Lane ; (2) Three Bibles in Ludgate Street. 1669-81. See Dictionary, 
1641-67. In 1674 Daniel Elzevir sent him 2,000 copies of Grotius, De 
Veritate Religionis Christianae, which were seized by the Custom House, but 
afterwards released. [S.P.D., Car. II, vol. 369, pp. 61, 62.] In 1679 he sold the 
library of Sir Edward Bysshe, the herald. He was the publisher, with Dring,

appointing his father's expectations was apprenticed in about 1674 to Thomas 
Parkhurst the bookseller. During his apprenticeship he headed an address of 
the Whig prentices against one of the Tories, and he seems to have been already 
somewhat volatile in conduct. After the expiration of his term he set up as 
a bookseller, at first taking only half a shop. He took to " printing ", i.e. 
publishing, at once ; his first books being Thomas Doolittle's The Lord's Last 
Sufferings, 1681 {T.C. I. 458], and Stephen Jay's Danielin the Den, a sermon 
by John Shower, and a collection of his father's funeral sermons, entitled 
The House oj Weeping, with a memoir by himself. He made a success with 
his publications, and opened a shop at the Black Raven, at the comer of 
Prince's Street, where in 1685 he published Maggots, being the anonymous 
juvenile poems of Samuel Wesley, father of John and Charles. Dunton had 
in 1682 married Elizabeth, daughter of Dr. Samuel Annesley, a leading 
Nonconformist preacher. In 1685 his business received a check by the 
" universal damp upon trade, occasioned by the defeat of Monmouth in the 
West " ; he went to Boston in New England to sell a cargo of books and at 
the same time recover debts to the extent of £500 owed him there, his business 
being largely in Puritan theology. Here he visited Elliot, who presented him 
with twelve copies of his Indian Bible. Dunton returned in 1686, but having 
given surety for £1,200 for a brother-in-law, was compelled to seek refuge in a 
tour in Holland and Germany. He returned in 1688 and opened a new shop 
opposite the Poultry Compter, with the old sign of the Black Raven, and 
tells us that he remained there ten years " with variety of successes and dis- 
appointments." \Life and Errors, pp. 151-2.] But his last entry in the Term 
Catalogues from this house was in 1694, after which he only made one more 
entry, in 1696, from the Black Raven, Jewen Street. After 1688 Dunton 
published copiously, some of his ventures being " projects " of his own, 
noteworthy among these being the Athenian Gazette, 1689-95, ^'^^ Post-Boy 
Robbed of His Mail (a collection of letters), and a laudatory life of Judge 
Jeffreys. In the course of his career Dunton claims to have printed 600 books 
(employing a large variety of printers), and to repent of but seven. In 1692 
he attained the Livery of the Stationers' Company. His first wife died in 
1697 ; in the same year he married Sarah Nicholas of St, Albans, with whom 
and her mother he quarrelled over the non-payment of his debts. Soon after 
his second marriage he visited Dublin with a cargo of books, and became 
engaged in a quarrel with a bookseller there, Patrick Campbell (^. z>.), which he

set forth at length with much else in his Dublin Scuffle, 1699. Dunton was 
now compelled to hide from his creditors and so to give up his business ; he 
employed his enforced leisure in much writing, in which growing insanity 
clearly appears. But in 1703 he wrote The Life and Errors of John Dunton 
(S. Malthus, 1705), in which he gives not only his autobiography, but characters 
of a vast number of his contemporaries in the book trade, which have been of 
the greatest value in the compilation of this Dictionary. After this he fell 
further into poverty. In the notes to the Dunciad Pope calls him " a broken 
bookseller and abusive scribbler ". He lived till 1733. [Life and Errors, ed, 
with memoir by J. B. Nichols, 1817 ; D.iV.B.]

Meade. [Chan. Proc. before 1714, Collins ff§, P.R.O.] In 1701 the publica-

also issued by her. Her first and last entries in the Term Catalogues are in

address by J. Baker. 

FABIAN (THOMAS), bookseller in London, Bible in St. Paul's Churchyard,

1676, when with Abel Roper and others he advertised a folio Josephus. 
[T.C. I. 241.] He was also the pubUsher of William Drummond's History of

FARLEY— FAWCET. 115

appears, and Faithome carried on the business alone until Trin. 1688 
[T.C. II. 232], after which nothing more is heard of him, unless he be the H. F. 
who appears in the imprint to The Muses' Farewel to Popery and Slavery , 
1689. [Haz. m. 200.] 

FARLEY (SAMUEL), printer at Bristol, St. Nicholas Street, near the Church,

FARLEY (SAMUEL), printer at Exeter and Salisbury, 1699-17 27. In 1699 
Samuel Darker of Exeter was joined by Farley, and together they printed 
several books of local interest until 1701, when Farley is found printing by 
himself. He appears to have settled in the parish of St. Paul's, Exeter, 
some time in 1699 and he continued to print in Exeter until 17 15, when he 
removed to Salisbury. In 1 705 he was joined by Joseph Bliss, but the partner- 
ship only lasted three years. On September 24th, 17 14, Farley issued the 
first number of The Exeter Mercury, or Weekly Intelligence of News, but he 
transferred this to Philip Bishop in 17 15, before leaving Exeter. He returned 
to Exeter in 1723 and started Farley's Exeter Journal. In November 1727,

It is not clear whether there were three or four booksellers of this name. 
The first appears in 1663 [Dictionary, 1641-67] ; the last is too late for our 
period. In 1678 the stock of Mercy Browning of Amsterdam {q. v.) was bought 
by a Rest Fenner of Canterbury, and an action was brought against him by 
Nathaniel Ponder for the value of part of it supplied by him. [Chanc. Proc.

R. Mount into partnership between 1684 and 1687. [T.C. II. 108, 195, 321.] 

. An entry by Hazlitt [ll. 529] of a book printed for an otherwise unknown 
William Firder in 1684 may be an error for William Fisher. 

FLEMING (ROBERT), printer in Edinburgh, 1724-78. One of the printers to 
the Church of Scotland. From 1724 to 1764 he printed in partnership with 
James Davidson. 

FLETCHER, or FLESHER (MRS.), printer in London, Little Britain, 1670- 
8 {?). The widow of James Fletcher. Her name occurs in a list of the 
printing-houses in London in March 1675. [State Papers Dom., Car. II, 
vol. 369, 97.] She may be identical with the E. F. {q. v.) mentioned in some 
imprints between 1670 and 1678. She was a daughter of Cornelius Bee, 
bookseller. 

FLETCHER (james), printer in London, 1652-70. See Dictionary, 1641-67.

filled by a stationer, but he withdrew in favour of " one Pottle ", who was 
neither bookseller nor stationer. [Hearne's Collections, Oxf. Hist. Soc. V. 192.] 
In 1 7 19 he proposed to print Marmora Oxoniensia, and consulted Hearne, 
who dissuaded him from the undertaking, [lb. VII. 6.] In 1721 Fletcher 
bought the library of Dr. John Keil, giving £220 for it. [lb. Vli. 301.] On 
August 22nd Hearne writes to J. Murray : " Stephen Fletcher (called by 
some positive Fletcher, and by others pos Fletcher) is gone to Shirboume in 



FLETCHER— FORRESTER. 119 

Dorsetshire, to get some of Mr. Jo. PuUen's books now selling there." [lb. 
VII. 395.] Fletcher died in London on September 12th, i727< From Heame's 
notice, it appears that Fletcher had a shop at Westminster as well as at 
Oxford. Hearne's sketch of his character is not flattering. [lb. ix. 347-8.] 

FLETCHER, or FLESHER (thomas), bookseller in London, (i) Angel and 
Crown, St. Paul's Churchyard ; (2) Old Change, over against Distaff Lane.

FOX (THOMAS), bookseller in London, (i) Angel in Westminster Hall ; (2) 
White Hart, Fleet Street, over against St. Dunstan's Church. 1679-91. 
What relation, if any, this bookseller had to Joseph Fox, is unknown, Thomas 
Fox appears to have begun business in the Hall in 1679, when his name 
appears in the Term Catalogue as one of the publishers of a History of Edward II. 
[T.C. I. 368.] In the same year he is found selling Cottoni Posthuma [T.C. I. 
376],and in 1680 BeA^wflfA, a pamphlet in answer to Hobbes. [T.C 1. 387.] On

as a bookseller, and in 1706, having purchased the printing-house which 
John Spottiswood had imported for the purpose of printing law books, he 
began to print. Many important books printed in Edinburgh during the 
next few years bear his imprint. In 171 1 he obtained a gift of the office of 
Queen's printer for forty-one years from the expiration of Andrew Anderson's 
privilege ; one-third of this gift he made over to John Baskett, and one-third 
to James Watson. At the Rebellion in 17 15 he retired to Perth and printed 
for the Pretender. [W. J. Cowper, The Pretender's Printer, 1918, and The 
King's Press at Perth, 1715-16, 1919.] For this his gift was declared forfeit.

but he afterwards returned to Edinburgh and resumed the style of royal 
printer. His assigns continued printing till 1752. 

FREEMAN ( ), bookseller in Durham, 1713-19. Mentioned in the 

Memoirs of Ambrose Barnes [p. 458] as in business at Durham in 17 13. In

did a large and general business. He moved in 1690 or 1 691. Dunton [p. 215] 
says of him, " He is of a courteous affable nature, and very obliging to all 
he has to do withal ; and I found (by that small correspondence I have had 
with him) he was bred, as well as born, a gentleman." In 17 13 he contributed 
five guineas to the Bowyer Fund. [Timperley, p. 600.] 

FRITH (JOHN), bookseller in London, Little Eastcheap, 1682-94. His name 
is found as publishing a broadside in 1682 [Haz. 11. 346], and in an advertise-

V. 274.]

of divinity ; but in 1682, he was one of the publishers of Sir William Dugdale's 
Antient Usage of . . . Armes. He is perhaps the person alluded to by Dunton

GARDNER (Robert), printer in Belfast, 1713-34. This printer was the third 
who practised the art in Belfast. 

GARRET (JOHN), bookseller in London, (a) at the foot of, {b) going up, the

cessor of Thomas Jenner ; he dealt in maps, gazetteers, &c. Dunton [p. 292] 
has a reference to " Indenture Garret ". He may have got the name by 
selling printed indenture forms. His first and last entries in the Term Cata- 
logues were made in Hil. 1676 and Mich. 1679. {T.C. I. 227, m. 39.]

GELLIBRAND (edward), bookseller in London, Golden Ball in St. Paul's

Sir John Temple's Irish Rebellion, 1679, and the 4th ed. of Sir William Temple's 
Observations on the United Provinces, 1679 [T.C. i. 377], and the 2nd ed. of 
the latter's Miscellanea, 1681. His last entry in the Term Catalogues was in 
Mich. 1682. \T.C. I. 503.] He was probably a son of Samuel Gellibrand, who

of Latin books. His first and last entries in the Term Catalogues are in 1680 
and 1684. {T.C. i. 385, 11. 99.] The Golden Ball does not appear in his 
address till 1683, and then his name is never found with Edward Gellibrand's 
in an announcement ; but it is reasonable to suppose that they were in 
partnership, as they used the same address. 

GELLIBRAND (samuel), bookseller in London, 1637-75. ^^^ Dictionary, 
1641-67. 

GENT (THOMAS), printer in London and York, (i) London, near the Two Fight- 
ing Cocks in Fleet Lane ; (2) York, Coffee- Yard. 1710-78. Only the early 
part of this printer's career concerns us, as it was not until the close of 1724 
that he set up in York. He was born in Ireland on May 4th, 1693, and was 
apprenticed to Powell the Dublin printer {q.v) about 1706, but was hardly 
treated by him and ran away. Arriving in London in August 17 10 he at 
once found employment with Edward Midwinter of Pye Comer, a printer 
of broadsides and chapbooks, and remained with him till 1713, after which 



GENT. ti$ 

he worked successively for short periods for Mrs. Bradford, a Quaker printer, 
and Mears, and then as a " smouter ", i. e. casually. On April 20th, 1714, he 
set out on foot for York, and there entered the service of John White (sen.). 
He remained in this employment a year, and fell in love with White's grand- 
daughter and maid Alice Guy, whom he was later to marry. He is said to 
have been dismissed by White upon the latter's learning that he had broken 
his apprenticeship With Powell ; but he himself says that his term being over 
he wished to visit his parents, and was " offered to be continued ". He visited 
Dublin, where he worked for Hume, and was seized by Powell. In 17 16 he 
was back in London with Midwinter, and in 171 7 was made a member of the 
Stationers' Company. Leaving Midwinter a second time he worked for John 
Watts and John Wilkins successively, and in 17 18 revisited Dublin, where he 
was again employed by Hume. On his return to London he took service with 
Francis Clifton, a Roman Catholic printer, and was engaged in a mysterious 
piece of illicit printing for Atterbury. Soon after this he was with Midwinter 
again. Clifton had printed for him a satire, Teague's Ramble, a.nd in 1722 he 
cut woodcuts to an abridged Robinson Crusoe for Midwinter. In 1722 or 
1723 he set up for himself in Fleet Lane and printed A Collection of Songs, 
and (with Hotham) a book of emblems entitled Divine Entertainments, with 
ballads and bills for the cockpits. Meanwhile he continued " smouting " 
for other master-printers. After his departure from York he had kept up 
a correspondence with Alice Guy, and the news of her marriage to Charles 
Bourne, his fellow workman under White, was a severe blow. He wrote 
a poem. The Forsaken Lover's Letter to his former Sweetheart, and gave it to 
Dodd the printer, who sold thousands of copies. At Dodd's death Gent 
undertook the management of the press for Mrs. Dodd, but in 1724, on 
hearing of Bourne's death, he hastened to York and married the widow on 
December loth, in spite of the younger White's opposition. He thus became 
a master-printer, the only one in York, and almost the only one in the North 
of England. The first books he printed were sermons, Thomas Clarke's 
The True Foundations of a Nation's Greatness, printed for F. Hildyard [1724], 
and Samuel Johnston's The Advantage of Employing the Poor, printed for 
R. Mancklin [1725]. He also issued The Original York Journal, a continuation 
of The York Mercury. White, who was printing at Newcastle-on-Tyne, set 
up a branch press in York, in opposition to Gent, and though the latter printed 
actively for many years, his business gradually failed and he fell into poverty,

dying in 1778 at the age of eighty-six. He wrote several topographical works 
of value, including a History of York, 1730, and a life of himself, partially 
edited in 1832 by Joseph Hunter, from which most of the known details of 
his life are drawn. He seems to have suffered from a violent and suspicious 
temper ; the Life is full of abuse of others and praise of himself. [Life ; 
Davies, York Press ; D.N.B.]

Dr. Joshua Barnes's edition of Euripides in folio. [Bowes.] He and Luke 
Meredith, (q. v.), married grand-daughters of Richard and Margaret Royston,

lunacy against their grandmother, and Green gave a bond to cover expenses. 
On the 24th December, 1698, judgement was given against him for £200. 
Green died September 1699, and by will left everything to his wife Mary. 
[Gray and Palmer, p. 132]. He was apparently indebted to Samuel Smith and 
Benjamin Walford, booksellers of London, at the time of his death. His wife, 
before satisfying them, also died (1699 or 1700), and they took out letters 
of administration. 

GREEN (ROBERT), bookseller in London, (i) near Ratcliffe Cross, London ;

principally in divinity. Made his first entry in the Term Catalogues in Michs 
1681, with Richard Allen's Instructions about Heart-Work. \T.C. i. 457.] 
Dunton, who succeeded him at the Black Raven, thus refers to him [p. 227] : 
" Served his apprenticeship with Mr. Cockril . . . Though he had contracted 
a large acquaintance and had Dr. Annesley's friendship, who helped him 
to 'Mr. Allen's Heart- Work ' and other saleable copies, yet he concluded 
trading at last with as small a pittance of the world as he had to begin it." 
He is last heard of in Mich. 1688. [T.C. 11. 237.] 

GREGORY (j.), bookseller in London, Cornhill, 1690. Published Great 
News from the Isle of Wight, 1690. [Haz. i. 455.] 

GRIERSON (ceorge), bookseller and printer in Dublin, 1709-33 (?). Was the 
first and most distinguished of several generations of a family of printers. 
He was first a bookseller (1709-14), but his imprint as printer is found in 
1715 and thenceforth frequently. In 1733 he was appointed King's printer 
in succession to Andrew Crooke. He was twice married, first to the learned 
and accomplished Constantia Grierson (her maiden name is not certain) and 
afterwards to a sister of James Blow, the chief Belfast printer. Grierson's 
press turned out a variety of books on different subjects, including several 
editions of the Book of Common Prayer, the Bible, some classics, and the 
Psalms, &c. 

GRIFFIN (bennet), bookseller and printer in London, Griffin in the Old 
Bailey, 1671-1700. Probably son of Edward Griffin II (1638-52). His name 
is joined with that of his mother Sarah Griffin as a printer ; but Bennet 
Griffin confined himself to bookselling for a time and published several 
notable works, including Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum, with an epitome of the 
NovumOrganum, 1683 [T.C. II. 34], and James Wright's History and Antiquities 
of the County of Rutland, 1684. He printed Buchanan's Latin Poems, 1686 
{T.C. II. 173], and an Epictetus for Sam. Keble, 1692. [Haz, 11, 204.] His 
name also appears first among the booksellers seUing Chauncy's Hertfordshire, 
1700, after which nothing more is heard of him. 

GRIFFIN (SARAH), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

GRIGG (G.), bookseller in London, near Charing Cross, 1717. Sold Jer. Owen's 
Sermon . . . to . . . Dissenters, 1717. [b.m. T, 1805 (11).]

GROINE ( ), stationer in London, Black Horse, between the two Temple

GROSVENOR (richard), bookseller in Wolverhampton, 1685-91 (?) In 
1684 or 1685 a broadside entitled The Loyal Speech of George Plaxton . . . upon 
the Proclamation oj . . . King James the Second was printed for him at London 
by J. Leake, [b.m. 8122. i. i (41).] Grosvenor is believed to have died in 
1691. 

GROVE (HUGH), bookseller and printer in Portsmouth, 1718. Mr. F. A. 
Edwards [Early Hampshire Printers (in Papers of the Hampshire Field Cltd), 
p. 115 n.] refers to a sermon by the Vicar of Portsmouth, printed by 
Hugh Grove, bookseller in Portsmouth, in 17 18 (communicated to him 
by a Mr. W. H. Long), as preceding the earliest Portsmouth printing 
previously known by thirty years ; but he does not give its author or title. 
It appears that Grove was both a printer and a publisher. 

GROVER (jAMES) and (thomas), printers and type-founders in London, (i) 
Pelican Court, Little Britain ; (i) Angel Alley, Aldersgate. 1676-1728. James 
Grover began as a printer about 1676. [Haz. i. 216.] He probably began as 
a type-founder at the same time, and in 1679 he cast the t)^s for an edition 
of Herodotus in Greek and Latin which was printed by E. Horton and pub- 
lished by J. Dunmore, R. Chiswell, B. Tooke, and T. Sawbridge, and they were 
used again in a fine edition of Cicero in two folio volumes, also published by 
Dunmore. Later he was joined by his son Thomas, and after Moxon's retire- 
ment from business the Grover foundry, with that of Joseph and Robert 
Andrews, shared between them the whole of the English trade. The most 
notable founts in their possession were a pica and long primer Roman from the 
Royal Press at Blackfriars, Day's double pica Roman and Italic, English 
Samaritan matrices from which the type for Walton's Polyglott Bible had been 
cast, and a Greek uncial fount, cut for the specimen of the Codex Alexandrinus 
which Patrick Young proposed to print, but did not live to accomplish^ 
The date of James Grover's death seems to be unknown ; but Thomas died

in 1728, after which the foundry remained nearly idle in the hands of Nutt, the 
printer, husband of one of his daughters, till 1758, when it was sold to 
John James. [Reed, The Old English Letter Foundries, p. 205.] 

GROVER (THOMAS), type-founder in London. See Grover (James). 

GUILLIM, see Gwillim. 

GUN, GUNN, or GUNNE (matthew), bookseller and printer in Dublin, Bible 
and Crown, Essex Street, i694-i7io(?). Described as a bookseller in 1694 ; 
in 1695 ^^ pubUshed a tract. The Rector's Case. [Bodl. G. Pamph, 2194 (15).] 
In 1696 he printed a quarto tract ; but he appears most often as a seller or 
publisher of books and not as a printer. He bought books largely at Dunton's 
auction at Dublin in 1698. [Dunton, p. 550.] In 1701 he published A Full 
Account of . . . Captain Kidd. [Haz. i. 245.] He was living in 1710 and 
perhaps later. 

GUNTER (LAURENCE), printer in Edinburgh, 1685. In partnership with 
J. Colmar. Their imprint appears on N. Paterson's Panegyrick to Thomas 
Kennedie, 1685. [Aldis, p. 69.] 

GUY (JOHN), bookseller in London, (i) at the Comer shop of Little Lombard 
Street and Comhill ; (2) Flying Horse, Fleet Street, between St. Dunstan's 
Church and Chancery Lane. 1670 (?)-i 709. Brother of Thomas Guy (q.v.) 
and a member of the Haberdashers' Company. He began in partnership with 
his brother, and in Mich. 1677 their joint names appear as sellers of Elisha 
Coles' English-Latin and Latin-English Dictionary. [T.C. i. 293.] After the 
partnership between the brothers was dissolved about 1679, while Thomas 
continued to occupy the premises in Comhill, John moved to the Flying 
Horse in Fleet Street, where he published in Easter Term, 1680, L. Maid well's 
tragedy. The Loving Enemies. [T.C. i. 394.] He either gave up business or 
ceased publishing shortly after this, as nothing more is heard of him. He 
died in 1709, his will being proved on July 5th. In this he mentions his 
sister Anne Vamam and her son Thomas Vamam, who succeeded his 
uncle Thomas Guy in his shop in 1711. He also mentions a cousin, 
Joseph Osborne, and he left the residue of his estate to his brother Thomas. 
[P.C.C. 170, Lane.] 

GUY (THOMAS), bookseller in London and Oxford ; London, at the Comer shop 
of Little Lombard Street and Comhill, 1668-1724. This famous bookseller 



GUY. 137 

was the eldest child of Thomas Guy, lighterman and coalmonger, and was 
bom in 1644 or 1645 in Pritchard's Alley, Fair Street, Horsley Down, South- 
wark. His father, an Anabaptist, died young, leaving three children, two 
of whom were boys, Thomas and John. Their mother returned to her native 
place, Tamworth. Here the children were educated, and the two boys were 
sent eventually to London and apprenticed to the trade of bookselling, 
Thomas on September 3rd, 1660, to John Clarke. Thomas, being the elder, 
was probably apprenticed a few years earlier than his brother John. At any 
rate Thomas took up his freedom in the Stationers' Company on October 7th, 
1668, and shortly afterwards set up in business for himself with a stock worth 
about ;^2oo. Some time about 1675 ^^ was joined by his brother John. It 
has been erroneously stated by Nichols [Lit. Anecd. HI. 599-600] that Thomas 
Guy laid the foundation of his bookselling business by engaging in the un- 
lawful importation of foreign printed Bibles : but what he and his brother 
did was to buy from the Stationers' Company large stocks of Bibles, &c., 
which the Company had seized on the wharves. Indeed, the King's printers 
actually seized these Bibles on the ground that they were illegally imported, 
then reprinted the first sheet, and issued them again as English Bibles, and 
thus sought to drive the Universities out of competition. This is made clear 
by an affidavit by John Guy. [Hist. MSS. Comm., Rept. xi, App. p. 274.] 
Before 1679 Thomas Guy, Peter Parker and Moses Pitt were called in to assist 
Oxford University in its attempt to put Bibles on the market at a 
cheaper rate and in better print than the King's printers were then doing. 
Consequently Pitt was appointed printer and Parker and the Guys managed 
the selling, with the result that the price of Bibles, Testaments, and Common 
Prayer Books was reduced very considerably. At the same time it must 
be confessed that Moses Pitt's earlier attempts at Bible printing were not 
much better typographically than those that were on the market before. 
The statement that Guy imported type from Holland is also misleading. 
It was Bishop Fell who imported Dutch letter, as is well known, for the 
express purpose of founding the Oxford Press. The assistance of the Guys 
was not called in until the opposition of the Stationers' Company became so 
dangerous that the University felt that it should have the help and guidance 
of some London booksellers, and choice was made of Parker, Pitt, and 
the Guys. John Guy dropped out of the partnership about 1679 ^"^ moved 
to the Flying Horse in Fleet Street ; Thomas Guy's name appears in the 



138 GUY— H. (J.). 

Term Catalogues for the last time in 1707. [T.C. III. 576.] According to 
Dunton [p. 205] Thomas Guy in 1703 occupied a high position among London 
booksellers and was an eminent figure in the Stationers' Company. A state- 
ment that Guy almost starved the bookbinders he employed^ may have been 
only ill-natured gossip. Certainly as early as 1678 Guy had founded at 
Tamworth an almshouse for six poor women, which he enlarged in 1693 to 
accommodate fourteen men and women. In 1701 he also built there a town 
hall, which is still standing. Many of his poorer relations received pecuniary 
help from him, and in many other ways he showed a generous nature. In 
1704 Guy became a governor of St. Thomas's Hospital, and in 1707 built and 
furnished three new wards. On August 5th, 1717, he offered the Stationers' 
Company £1,000 to enable them to add to the quarterly charity to poor 
members and widows. Guy had conceived the idea of providing for the many 
patients who could not be taken into St. Thomas's Hospital or were discharged 
thence as incurable. In 1721 he leased from the Governors a piece of ground 
opposite, and, having pulled down a number of small houses, began the 
erection of a hospital, ever since known as Guy's. The building, which cost 
£18,793, was roofed in before the founder's death, which took place on Decem- 
ber 27th, 1724, in his eightieth year. Guy's will was proved on January 4th, 
1724-5. It was afterwards printed and went through three editions in 1725, 
being reprinted by the governors of the Hospital in 1732. It dealt principally 
with the government of the Hospital. [Works quoted ; D.N.B.] 

GWILLIM, or GUILLIM (JOHn), bookseller in London, against Crosby Square 
in Bishopsgate Street, 1684-1707. According to Dunton [p. 224] John 
Guillim or Gwillim was originally a clasp-maker. He took up bookselling, 
attended Bristol fair every year and was a thriving man. He is first mentioned 
in the Term Catalogues in 1684, when, in company with S. Sprint, he published 
an astrological work by John Gadbury. [T.C. il. 103.] In 1707 he was 
party to an action brought by the Company of Stationers for the infringe- 
ment of their patents. [Chan. Proc. before 17 14, Bridges ^^ P.R.O.] 

GWILLIM (PHILIP), printer in London, at his Wharf at the end of Bur Street in

in 1703 [p. 217], refers to a Mr. Halsey as a " man of good judgement ; his 
great ingenuity and knowledge of the learned Languages have justly entitled 
him to the friendship of Athens " [i. e. of Dunton's Athenian Society]. In 
1 711 he appears in an advertisement as one of those from whom catalogues 
of a book-sale could be procured [Daily Courant, January 19th], and in the 
same year he advertised a preparation called " The Britannick Beautifyer ". 
[Postman, February 8th.] In 1703 he published the Rev. J. Hancock's

Alley, {b) at the first shop in Pope's Head Alley, next Comhill. 1673-1705. 
Son of John Hancock, senior. Their joint names are found for the first 
time in Hil., 1673, as publishing certain sermons by WilHam Bridge 
[T.C. I. 126], but the date of his father's death and of his succession to the 
business is not known. In March 1676-7 he was committed for selling 
copies of a pamphlet called The Long Parliament Dissolved, which he said 
he had received from Mrs. Brewster, paying her a groat for each copy. On 
promise of amendment he was released. [Hist. MSS. Comm., gth Report, 
App., p. 70.] The firm published chiefly divinity, and Hancock's name 
continues to appear in the Term Catalogues until Easter 1705. [T.C. m. 458.] 
In 1679 the name of " John Hannock ", probably a misprint for Hancock, 
is found as selling Capt. W. Bedloe's Narrative of the Burning of London. 
Dunton [p. 224] refers to him as " an old friend and acquaintance ", and 
states that he " printed " works by Thomas Brooks, and got a considerable 
estate by bookselling.

Mich. 1678 Christopher Nesse's Christian's walk and work on earth . . . Second 
edition. [T.C. i. 336.] Dunton became acquainted with John Harding 
at Sturbridge Fair and dealt with him for several years, finding him [p. 223] 
" a very honest man, an understanding bookseller and a zealous Church 
of England man, yet no bigot ". In 1684 he moved to Leicester Fields, 
and among his apprentices was Bernard Lintot, who had been turned over to 
him from Tho. Linyard. In 1709, among those who received subscriptions 
for the Corpus omn. vet. Poetarum Latinorum was — Harding, in St. 
Martin's Lane, who is probably identical with John Harding. \T.C. ill. 
657.] In 1 7 13 he subscribed to the fund for the relief of WiUiam Bowyer 
the elder. 

HARDING (JOHN), printer in Dublin, 172 1-4. In 1721 he printed a History

HAREFINCH— HARFORD. 143 

HAREFINCH (JOHN), printer and bookseller in London, Montague Court in 
Little Britain, 1682-1690 (?). In 1682 he printed for H. Rhodes a novel

in Trin. 1677. [T.C. I. 285.] He published a news sheet called Mercurius 
Anglicus (no. i, November 20th, 1679). No. 12 appeared as The True News 
or Mercurius Anglicus ; unlike other " Mercuries ", which consisted of one 
leaf, the first eleven numbers consisted of two leaves or four pages ; but 
this was soon found too expensive, and it reverted to the ordinary form 
in no. 12. It contained a few advertisements, chiefly of books published by 
Harford. Amongst his varied publications was Edmund Halley's CaicUogus 
SteUarum Australium in Mich. 1678. [T.C. I. 335.] 

HARFORD (ROBERT), jun., stationer and bookseller in London, St. Paul's

The Irish Massacre, 17 14, as a place where pamphlets were sold. 

HARFORD or HARTFORD (Robert), bookseller at Portsmouth, 1675-95. 
His name appears in an advertisement of Dr. Sermon's Pills. The business 



144 HARFORD— HARRIS. 

was continued for a long period, the name of Mrs. Harford, bookseller,

HARGRAVE (d.) or (Richard), bookseller in London, (i) against Fumivalls Inn 
Gate ; (2) Fleet Street, 1689-1713 (?). In the Term Catalogues for Hil. and 
Easter 1696, he is mentioned as joint publisher with S. Heyrick of Sir Thomas 
Raymond's Reports. [T.C. II. 568, 579.] In one of these entries his initial 
is given as D., in the other R. In 1713 a Richard Hargrave was connected 
with the publication of a pamphlet called The Art of being Honest for a 
little Time, which was the outcome of a dispute amongst the parish 
authorities of St. Dunstan's in the West. It gave the names of all the 
inhabitants who paid the Scavenger's Rate in 17 13-14, and though the trades 
of the persons named were omitted many stationers and booksellers of that 
period are named. [b.M. 796. c. 35.] In The London Gazette, October 28th- 
31st, 1689, " Mr. Hargrave " against Furnivall's Inn Gate is mentioned in 
an advertisement of a sale as one of those from whom catalogues could be 
obtained. 

HARIS (f.), see Harris. 

HARPER ( ), bookseller at Hallaton, Leicester, 1687. Defendant in 

an action for trespass brought against him by Henry Hitchcock. [C.P.R., 
Hil. 2-3 Jas. II (i68f). Roll 3052, m. 125 verso.] 

HARPER (CHARLES), bookseller in London, The Flower de Luce, Fleet Street, 
1670-1709. His name first appears in the Term Catalogues in Easter 1670, 
[T.C. I. 40,] He was a prolific publisher of divinity. A list of books printed 
for him in 1684 will be found at the end of The Laws of Jamaica, 1684. 
Dunton [p. 210] thus describes him : "I believe him an honest man and 
a warm votary for High Church. He printed Mr. Wesley's ' Life of Christ ', 
and makes a considerable figure in the Stationers Company." Harper was 
Junior Warden of the Company in 1 699-1 700. The Flower de Luce was 
an old building standing at the corner of Fetter Lane and Fleet Street, and 
in the first quarter of the seventeenth century was occupied by John Hodgets 
the bookseller. [See Dictionary, 1557-1640.] 

HARRIS (benjamin), bookseller and printer in London and Boston, New 
England ; London, (i) Bell Alley, Coleman Street ; (2) (a) Sweeting's Alley, 
Comhill, (i) Stationer's Arms, Sweeting's Rents, near the Royal Exchange ; 



HARRIS. 145 

(3) Maiden Head Court in Great East Cheap ; (4) Golden Boar's Head in 
Gracechurch Street, or, at the corner of Gracechurch Street, next Cornhill ; 
Boston, (i) by the Town Pump near the Change ; (2) over against the Old 
Meeting House ; (3) Bible, over against the Blue Anchor. 1 673-1 708. 
The following sketch of this notorious character is chiefly an abridgement 
of Mr. P. L. Ford's Introduction to his edition of the New England 
Printer, 1897. Benjamin Harris makes his first appearance as a book- 
seller in the Term Catalogue for Mich. 1673, when he issued, from Bell 
Alley in Coleman Street, a work entitled War with the Devil. \T.C. i. 147.] 
His chief characteristic at this time seems to have been an ardent Protestant- 
ism. At the time of the Popish Plot he threw himself actively into the fray 
and published a large number of ballads, broadsides, and tracts against the 
Pope and the Jesuits, as well as printing the Doniestick Intelligence and other 
news-sheets with the same object. In 1679 he issued An Appeal from the 
Country to the City, Jar the Preservation of His Majesty's person and the Pro- 
testant Religion. This gave great oflfence to the Government, and Harris 
was brought to trial for " printing and sending it ", and he was ordered to 
find security for his good behaviour for three years. Harris himself printed 
the account of this trial. Unwarned by his experience, Harris in 1681 printed 
a Protestant Petition and was again prosecuted. This time the judge fined 
him £500 and ordered him to be put in the pillory, a sentence that was duly 
carried out. After this he left England and went to America, and Dunton, 
writing from Boston, said, " Old England is now so uneasie a place for 
honest men that those that can will seek out for another country : And this 
I suppose is the case of Mr. Benjamin Harris and the two Mr. Hows whom 
[sic] I hear are coming hither ". [Dunton, Letters from New England, 1867, 
p. 144.] Harris set up a book and cofEee, tea, and chocolate shop " by the 
Town Pump near the Change " in Boston in 1686. Here too he was quickly 
involved with the authorities, for in 1690 he issued without permission the 
first newspaper printed in America, under the title of Public Occurrences, 
which was suppressed by proclamation. Sometime between 1687 and 1690 
Harris issued the first edition of The New England Primer, of which no copy 
is known. In Henry Newland's almanac, entitled News from the Stars, 
" printed by R. Pierce for Benjamin Harris at the London Coffee House in 
Boston, 1691 " (and consequently printed late in 1690), the last leaf advertised 
a second impression of The New England Primer, enlarged. In 1691 Harris

formed a partnership with John Allen and became Printer to the Governor 
and Council, and removed his business to a shop " over against the Old 
Meeting House ", making another move in 1694 to " the Sign of the Bible, 
over against the Blew Anchor ". But evidently things did not prosper 
with him, and towards the end of 1695 ^^ returned to England and opened 
a printing office at Maiden Head Court in Great East Cheap, and in 1703 
Dunton [p. 217] writes, " He is now both Bookseller and Printer in Grace- 
church Street, as we find by his London Post." The last entry under Harris's 
name in the Term Catalogues was in Mich. 1701, and his death is believed to 
have taken place about 1708. Partridge in his Almanac says that Benjamin 
Harris and his son had added a supplement of their own to his almanac in 
1704 and 1705. 

HARRIS (ELIZABETH), bookseller in London, Harrow in Little Britain, 1699- 
171 1. Widow of John Harris. Dunton says [p. 223] that she printed his 
Panegyrick on the Lord Jeffreys, The Great Historical Dictionary, The Present 
State oj Europe, " and other copies that have sold well ". 

HARRIS (f.), bookseller in London, 1682. A political pamphlet entitled 
War Horns make room for the Bucks with Green Bowes, bears the imprint, 
" London, printed for F. Haris, 1682 ". [Haz. i. 288 ; b.m. 1077. h. ^ii\ 

HARRIS (GEORGE), bookseller in London, Queen's Head, St. James's Street, 
1703-21. Published in 1703 a volume of verse called Poems on Several 
Occasions, [b.m. 11633. e. 52.] In 1721 he was one of the publishers of 
Paul Chamberlen's series of novels called Love in its Empire. [Esdaile, p. 183.] 

HARRIS (Gabriel), bookseller in Gloucester, 1702-22. Published two sermons 
preached at Colford, Gloucester, one by William Harrison of Stanton, the

See Went. 

HARRIS (JOHN), bookseller in London, (i) Harrow against the Church in 
the Poultry ; (2) Harrow in Little Britain, 1685-98. This bookseller was the 
particular friend of John Dunton, who devotes two pages [231-2] of his 
Life and Errors to a description of him. Dunton and he were partners in 
Coke's Detection, The Secret History of Whitehall, Leyboum's Panarithmologia, 
and " thirty other valuable books ". Dunton further says, " from the day 
I left my shop in the Poultry, I put all I printed into John's warehouse and

found him always ready to even accompts, and to discharge his trust to 
a half-farthing ". George Larkin the printer is said to have composed the 
following couplet on Harris : 

Of all honest Booksellers if you'd have the Marrow, 
Repair to King John, at the Sign of the Harrow. 

Harris made his first entry in the Term Catalogues in Mich. 1685. A pleasant 
and compendious History of the first Inventers, 1686, published and probably 
written by him, has at the end a list of seven books, five religious and all 
popular, printed for him. [b.m. 1137. a. 37.] He moved to Little Britain 
sometime in 1695 or 1696, and is believed to have died some time in 1698, 
his business being continued for some years by his widow Elizabeth Harris. 

HARRIS (s.), bookseller in London, 1703. A novel entitled A Banquet Jor 
Gentlemen and Ladies was published by S. Harris in 1703. [Esdaile, p. 157.]

where, he refers to " Robin Hayhurst, who lived by printing of false news ".

In 1691 he was agent for the proposals for printing Synodicon in Gallia Refor- 
mata. [T.C. II. 388.] Hide probably died in or before 1698, for his stock was

1680 (?)-i73i. His name is first found in George Meriton's Praise of 



154 HILDYARD— HILLS. 

Yorkshire Ale, printed for him by J. White in 1685 (3rd ed. 1697). In this 
year he printed a sale catalogue ; so that he must have been in business for 
some years already. In 1695 he was associated with the Churchills in pub- 
lishing M. Micklethwait's version of Olivaires of Castile. [Haz. ill. 159 ; 
I. 310.] Ten years later Dunton [p, 237] could speak of him as " the topping 
man in that city ". In the Post Boy of February 20th, 171 1 he advertised 
for subscriptions to a Corpus omnium veterum Poetarum Latinorum. He 
was succeeded at his death in 1731 by his son John Hildyard, who died in

Prince's Arms, Leadenhall Street, over against St. Mary Axe, 1700-7. 
Referred to by Dunton [p. 292] as " independent Hiller ". Publisher of Cotton

records Youth's Tragedy, A Poem, by T. S. " London, Printed and sold by 
Nath. Hillier, 1707." [Haz. I. 370.] 

HILLS (gilham), printer (?) in London, 1737. According to Nichols [Lit. 
Anecd. VIII. 168] Gilham Hills, printer, was son of Henry Hills junior, and 
died in 1737. In this case he must be distinguished from his namesake and 
uncle, son of Henry Hills senior {q.v.). The date of his death makes Nichols's 
statement probable. 

HILLS (henry), sen., printer in London, 1641-89. See Dictionary, 1641-67. 
As considerable confusion and error is found in all the accounts of the later 
life of this printer, the D.N.B. for example stating that he died in 1713, 
the following additional information about him is now recorded. About 
the year 1670 Henry Hills, sen., became one of the assigns of John Bill the 
Second and Christopher Barker the Third in the King's Printing House in 
Blackfriars. He afterwards became a Roman Catholic, with the result 
that on December 12th, 1688, a mob attacked the printing house in Black- 



HILLS. 155 

friars, " spoiled his Formes, Letters, &c., and burnt 200 or 300 reams of 
paper printed and unprinted." [English Currant, December I2th-i4th, 
1688.] Hills fled for his life to St. Omer, where he died shortly afterwards, 
his will being proved on January 21st, 1689. Probate was granted to 
Gilham Hills his son by his first wife ; the executors were Elizabeth Hills 
the widow and Adiell Mill, being one a recusant and the other a bankrupt. 
His children were Henry Hills jun., Gilham Hills, James Hills, and George 
Hills, the two latter by his second wife. He also had a son John, who was 
dead at the time of the making of the will, and a daughter Dorothy, married 
to a man named Edwin. [P.C.C. 6, Dyke.] Both his sons Henry and 
Gilham became printers and during his father's lifetime, Henry Hills jun. 
was so-called, in spite of which he has been confused with his father. One 
of them, presumably the father, was junior warden of the Company of 
Stationers in 1682-4, &nd Master in 1687-g. 

HILLS (henry), jun., printer in London, (a) on the Ditch-side, (b) near the 
water-side, in Blackfriars, 1680 (?)-i7i3. The son of Henry Hills, senior, 
the King's Printer. His initials " H. H. jun." are found on an undated 
edition of Julius Caesar, printed about 1680, and have been taken to stand 
for Henry Herringman, jun., but Henry Herringman the publisher left no son. 
{See Dictionary, 1641-67.) In 1683 Henry Hills, jun., printed for W. Davis 
An Elegy upon . . . the Lord Capel [b.m. C. 20. f. 2 (157)], and in the same 
year, The Presentment of the Grand Jury oj Bristol [Bodl.]. On the death 
of his father Henry Hills, jun., succeeded to his father's share in the King's 
Printing House, and dropped the word " junior ", which has been the cause 
of much confusion. He became notorious for pirating every good poem 
or sermon that was published, " a circumstance ", says Nichols, " which 
led to the direction in the Act of 8 Anne that fine-paper copies should be 
presented to the public libraries ". [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. Vlii. 168.] A large 
number of these pirated duodecimos appeared in 1709 and 17 10. In a poem 
on Lintot's Miscellanies, ascribed to Dr. King, occur the following lines. 

While neat old Elzevir is reckoned better 

Than Pirate Hill's brown Sheets and scurvy Letter. 

Henry Hills, jun., died in 1713, and an advertisement appeared in the 
Evening Post of November 12th to the effect that his stock, " consisting of 
the most eminent Sermons, Poems, Plays, &c., is now to be disposed of.

at the Blue Anchor, Paternoster Row. N.B, There can never be any of the 
same, or any in the Hke manner, reprinted after these are gone, there being 
an Act of Parliament to the contrary ". Nichols states that Gilham Hills 
the printer was his son. [vni. i68.] Many of his cheap reprints, 1708-10,

[b.m. P.P. 3424 c], but the earliest copy recorded by Messrs. Hyett and 
Bazeley [il. 162] is that of July 25th, 1720. They say, however, that Hinton 
must have established his press two or three years before Raikes came to 
Gloucester. This paper was published weekly, and the civil year was used in 
dating it, so no. i must have appeared about the last week of October 1718. 
His son Thomas was a bookseller at the Talbot in Tetbury in 1720, [Hyett 
and Bazeley, i. 20.] 

HIRST (JOHN), printer and bookseller at Leeds, over against Kirkgate-End, 
1718 (?)-3o. He printed and sold The Leeds Mercury (vol. ii, no. 49, April

HISLOP (ARCHIBALD), bookseller and printer in Edinburgh, in the Parliament 
Yard at the sign of the Bible, 1670-8. Watson [p. 11] says, " Archbald 
Hyslop, a bookseller, set up, taking in with him William Carron, a very 
excellent workman, who advis'd Mr. Hyslop to bring new materials from 
Holland. They printed Thomas a Kempis very neatly, and some other 
small books ; to which is prefix'd sometimes the name of the one, and 
sometimes the name of the other ". No book is known bearing Hislop's

name as printer, but an edition of Tlie Psalms in meeter was printed for him 
in 1670 by A. Anderson, and he was one of those who sold James Kirkwood's 
Rhetoricae Compettdium in 1678. There were two bookbinders of this name 
in Edinburgh. The will of the earlier was registered on July loth, 1679, 
and he may have been identical with the bookseller. The other bookbinder 
died in 1697, his will being registered on June 8th. According to Watson 
[p. 14] this printing house passed into the hands of John Cairns. [Aldis, 
pp. 114-15-] 

HIVE (T.), bookseller in London, Nag's Head, Jewen Street, 1695 (?). The 
second edition of John Taylor the Water Poet's Verbum Sempiternum,

in the imprint to Henry Can tr ell's Royal Martyr a True Christian, 1716. 

HODGKIN (THOMAS), prmter and bookseller in London, next door to the 
Dolphin Inn, West Smithfield, 1677-1713. This printer is first met with in 
the proceedings taken by the House of Lords in February 1676-7 to discover 
the printers and vendors of certain libellous pamphlets. Hodgkin was called 
before the Committee as a witness in regard to the tract entitled Some Con- 
siderations upon the question whether the Parliament is dissolved by its Proroga- 
tion for fifteen months, but all he could say was that he had been unable to 
find out who printed it. He was probably only a workman at that time. 
\Hist. MSS. Comm., gth Report, App., pp. 69-78.] In 1686 his name appears 
as a bookseller, when he sold the Thirty-six Sermons of the Bishop of Lincoln. 
[T.C. n. 191.] In 1688 he is recorded as the printer of an edition of Suetonius. 
[T.C. II. 230.] He was also the printer in 1690 of the seventeenth edition of

published Edward Eccleston's opera The Cataclysm. [T.C. II. 114.] His 
last entry was in 1689. [T.C. II. 275.] He was probably a relative of S. Hol- 
ford, who published from the same address at the same time. His two 
addresses probably describe the same house. 

HOLFORD (SAMUEL), bookseller in London, Crown in the Pall Mall, 1685-8. 
Began to publish about 1685 with Dr. Nehemiah Grew's Musceum Regalis 
Societatis [T. C. 11. 150], and John Holford appears to have been in partner- 
ship with him. He sold books on all subjects, and distributed the sale 
catalogue of Lord Maitland in 1689. He is last heard of in 1694, when with 
J. Taylor of Paternoster Row he published TJie Swordsman's Vade Mecum.

lacium Anglicanum, Containing a derivation of English words, for Randall 
Taylor. In 1690 she printed for Thomas Basset, Locke's Essay concerning 
Human Understanding. She is probably the " widow Holt " who was ordered 
to lay down the trade of printing, see Holt (R.). Dunton's reference [p. 292] 
to " virgin Holt " may be to a daughter. 

HOLT (r.), printer in London, 1671-88. In 1671-3 he and Evan Tyler, some- 
times as R. H. and E. T., printed in partnership ; in 1672 their names appear

In i686-8 he was in partnership with E. Horton ; they printed Sir Roger 
Manley's Commentaria de Rebellione Anglicana, as well as A Relation of the 
Conference between William Laud . . . and Mr. Fisher the Jesuit . . . which 
they printed for J. Mitchell and R. Hughes. {T.C. il. 171.] E. Horton 
apparently died soon after, for Holt was in partnership with W. Horton in 
1688 for the printing of Florio's Italian and English Dictionary, and Torriano's 
Vocabolario. [Haz. 11. 600.] Holt is believed to have died in 1688, as an order 
was made in that year by the Company of Stationers that the widow Holt 
[see Holt (Elizabeth)] and others should lay down the trade of printing in 
obedience to the Act of Parliament. [Records of Stat. Co.]

however, Horton was employed to print some notable editions of the classics, 
and these books may rank with the best work of that period. The first

HOW (job), printer in London, c. 1700. Mentioned by Dunton [p. 250] as

entitled Some Thoughts on the present state of Printing and Bookselling [b.M. 
1 1 901. a. 2 (3)], in which he attacks various fellow-printers for piracy while

for many years, and now follows the trade of printing. ... He is a true lover 

of his Queen and Country [i. e. a Whig] He was a great sufiferer in King 

James's reign, and has had the fate of being a traveller. ... He is now settled 
in Gracechurch Street ; and, being a great Projector (as we see by the 
London Spy and the Observator, &c.), is likely to increase apace." His 
sufferings and travels here spoken of, possibly due to his political party, 
account for the gap in our record of him. See How (Job).

he does not appear again in London unless he be the Mr. Hunt who in 1693 
was advertised as receiver of contributions to the Philosophical Transactions 
[T.C. II. 466], and in 1699 published Dr. Edward Tyson's Orang-Outang.

that his materials were bought from his executors in 17 18 by one Cook. 

INGHALL (WILLIAM), senior, bookbinder and bookseller in London, 1681-2. 
A broadside entitled The Character of a Tory bears the imprint : " London :

(16).] In the next year Inghall is found publishing The Irish Evidence. 

INNYS (JOHN), see Innys (WiUiam). 

INNYS (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, Prince's Arms, St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1 71 1-32. One of the leading booksellers in London in the first quarter of 
the eighteenth century. Succeeded B. Walford at this house. He made his 
first entry in the Term Catalogues in Easter 1711. {T.C. III. 659.] In 1713 
he subscribed five guineas to the Bowyer fund. He was afterwards joined 
by John Innys. In 1720 they issued an eight-page miscellaneous catalogue 
of books printed for them, including Clarendon's History of the Rebellion, 
6 vols. ; Strype's Life of Archbishop Whitgift ; and Le Neve's Monumenia 



i68 INNYS— JAFFRAY. 

Anglicana, 5 vols. In 1722 they were among the booksellers receiving sub- 
scriptions for a folio edition of Sir Henry Spelman's Works. [Nichols, Lit. 
Anecd., I. 240.] They were also the publishers of many of Sir Isaac Newton's 
works. They were still at work in 1732. [Roberts, Cambridge Press, p. 91.] 

ISTED (j.), bookseller in London, Golden Ball against St, Dunstan's Church 
in Fleet Street, 171 1-25. He was advertising books in the news sheets of 
1711, and was still publishing in 1725 when he issued the Miscellaneous 
Works of Dr. William Wagstaffe. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. I. 323.] 

J. (s.), bookseller in London, 1681. Published in 1681 two sheets, Mistris 
Celiers Lamentation for the loss of Iter Liberty, and A Dialogue between the 
Pope and the Devil, about Owen and Baxter. [Haz. ii. 88, 174.] 

J. (t.), printer in London, 1672-82. These initials, which may be those of 
Thomas James, are found in A New Help to Discourse, advertised in Hil. 
1672, as printed by T. J. for Peter Parker. [T.C. I. 100.] They recur in an 
edition of Hannah WooUey's Gentlewoman's Companion, 1682, " printed

JACOB (wnxiAM), bookseller in London, Btack Swan near Bernards-Inn 
Gate, in Holbom, 1670-80. Publisher of law-books and divinity. His 
first and last entries in the Term Catalogues were made in Easter 1670 and 
Trin. 1680. [T.C. i. 39, 405.] 

JACKSON (david), bookseller in London, Bible and Three Crowns, Cheapside, 
near Mercer's Chapel, 1700-16 (?). Prof. Arber gives under his name in the 
Index to the Term Catalogues (vol. ill) a reference to Parkhurst, whom he 
apparently succeeded at this address. In 17 10 he joined N. Cliff (q. v.), and 
disappeared by 17 16. Dunton [p. 293] has a reference to " candid " Jackson, 
who may or may not be the same person.

door ; (2) his Printing House within the Head of Peebles Wynd. 1696-17 10. 
" In 1696 George Jaffray set up a small printing-house ; it is now extinct." 



JAFFRAY— JAMES. 169 

[Watson, p. 18.] Probably son of William {q. v.). No books have been noted 
bearing Jaffray's name before 1700. [Aldis, p. 115.] He moved to his second 
house in 1702 or 1703. 

JAFFRAY (WILLIAM), stationer in Edinburgh, 1695. Will registered December 
30th, 1695 ; together with those of Margaret Walker, his relict, and Andrew 
Dunbar, her last husband. [Scottish Record Soc, Index to Edinburgh Testa- 
ments.] Probably father of George {q. v,). 

JAKIN (ELLEN), stationer (?) in London, at the end of St. Paul's Alley, in 
St. Paul's Churchyard, i68o. In 1680 a pack of cards commemorating the 
Popish Plot was advertised for sale by several dealers, amongst them the 
above ; but she may not have been a stationer. [T.C. I. 384.] 

JAMES (GEORGE), printer in London, Little Britain, 1712 (?)-35. Author and 
printer of the Post Boy. Perhaps brother of John and Thomas James, type- 
founders, but see Reed, p. 212 note. The inter-relationship of the members 
of the James family engaged in the trade at this time is obscure. 
Negus in his list of 1724 describes George as a " High-Flyer ". In 1724 he 
succeeded Alderman Barber as City printer. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. I. 305,] 
He died in 1735. His sister Elizabeth married Jacob Hive the printer. 

JAMES (THOMAS), bookseller and mathematical printer to the King, Printing 
Press, Mincing Lane, 1 678-1 711. Great-grandson of Thomas James, Keeper 
of the Bodleian Library. Unless he is to be identified with the T. J. (q. z?.) 
who printed in 1672, he began printing about 1678. In i68o he printed for 
T. Vile a Weekly Advertisement of Books. James died in 171 1 and his books, 
which he bequeathed to the public, were offered to and accepted by Sion 
College. In the College is a portrait of James. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. 1. 308.J 

JAMES (THOMAS), type-founder in London, Bartholomew Close, 1710-36. 
Son of the Rev. John James, Vicar of Basingstoke. Served his apprentice- 
ship with Robert Andrews and began business in Aldermanbury, whence 
he removed to Town Ditch and finally settled in Bartholomew Close. In 
1 7 10 he went to Holland, and after considerable trouble returned to England 
with 3,500 matrices of various founts of roman and italics, as well as sets 
of Greek and some black letter. William Ged's attempt to introduce 
stereotype printing failed owing largely to the action of James and his 
workmen. James's prosperity declined, and he died in 1736, being succeeded 



lyo JAMES— JANUA. 

by his son John, who had for some time managed the business. [Plomer, 
Short History of English Printing, 1915, p. 196 ; Reed, pp. 212-20.] 

JANEWAY (ELIZABETH), bookseller in Chichester, 1697. Published A Sermon 
preached . . . at the Assizes held at Horsham . . . March 2^, i6g6/i. By Peter 
Heald, A.M., Prebendary in the Cathedral Church at Chichester. [T.C. ill. 12 ; 
Bodl. Sermons, 9.] 

JANEWAY (RICHARD), senior, printer, bookseller, and bookbinder in London, 
(a) Queen's Head Alley, (b) Queen's Head Court, Paternoster Row, i68o- 
98(?). Like Benjamin Harris, Langley Curtis, and Nathaniel Thompson, 
Janeway became notorious as a fanatically Protestant publisher in the time of 
the Popish Plot. His first entry in the Term Catalogues is in Easter 1680, and 
is characteristically entitled The Tryal, conviction and condemnation of Popery 
for High Treason. [T.C. i. 397-8.] In this year he sold also A Defence of True 
Protestants, spelling his name " Janua ". [Title-page only in Bagford Coll., 
B.M., Harl. 5927 (504).] Janeway quarrelled with other publishers of 
Protestant news-sheets and retorted in The Impartial Protestant Mercury 
and The New News Book, both of which he started in 168 1. In that year 
he also brought an action for assault against Thomas Newcombe, John 
Towse, Randal Taylor, and Michael Foster, all of them stationers. The 
details of the case are wanting ; but it was probably connected with a 
search carried out on his premises by the Company of Stationers. [C.P.R. 
2296, m. 256 r.] His name drops out of the Term Catalogues in Easter 1690. 
[T.C. III. 318.] He is probably the " honest Dick Janeway ", the binder, 
described by Dunton [p. 257] apparently as dead in 1703. He was probably 
alive in 1698, as Richard Janeway junior {q. v.) describes himself as such in 
that year. 

JANEWAY (RICHARD), junior, printer in London, Dogwell Court, Whitefriars, 
near Fleet Street, 1698-1724. Probably son of Richard Janeway, senior. 
In 1698 The Lancashire Levite Rebuk'd was " printed by Richard Janeway, 
junr." He is probably the Janeway given in Negus's list of printers, 
1724, as being in White Friars [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. I. 291], and also the 
Janeway who printed occasionally for Dunton both before and after the 
latter's misfortunes, c. 1698 [p. 250] ; Negus classes him among the printers 
" well affected to King George ". [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. i. 291.] 

JANUA (RICHARD), see Janeway (Richard), senior. 



JAQUES— JENOUR. 171 

JAQUES (JOSEPH), bookseller at Midhurst in Sussex, 171 2. Sold the Rev.

book auctions. [London Gazette, August 9th-i3th, 1694.] 

JEFFERY (EDMUND), bookseller in Cambridge, 1699-1729, living in the High 
Street two doors south of the Green Dragon, and later, from 17 19 to 1729, 
at what is now No. i Trinity Street, succeeding William Dickinson (g.v.), 
and being succeeded by Wm. Thurlbum {q. v.). His publications were princi- 
pally sermons preached before the University. For John Leng's Sermon of 
1699 we learn that he and R. Clavel of the Peacock in St. Paul's Church-yard, 
London, paid i6s. per sheet for printing the 1,000 copies. [Bowes, Cambridge 
Books, note to no. 105,] A catalogue of some of his publications is to be found 
in J. Hughes's edition of Chrysostom de Sacerdotio, 17 10. 

JENKINSON (ROBERT), bookseller in London, 1690. Publisher of The Judge- 
ment of the Foreign Reformed Churches concerning . . . the Church of England,

Gilt-Spur Street, 1707-25. Printed Povey's news-sheet. The General Remark

Post and was numbered among those " well affected to King George " by 
Negus. Later he became "the first establisher of the Daily Advertiser", 
a paper which for many years stood at the head of all the diurnal publications. 



172 JENOUR— JOHNSON. 

""■Mr. Jenour was a man of very respectable character, and the Daily Advertiser 
enriched his family ". [Nichols, Lit. Anecd., i. 290-1.] 

JOHNSON (ANDREW), bookseller in Lichfield and Birmingham, 1694 (?)-i 702 (?). 
Younger brother of Michael and Benjamin Johnson. Apprenticed to the 
latter at the age of 23, in 1683, for seven years, but never made free of the 
Company. He assisted his brother Michael at Lichfield, and on his own 
account published the first Birmingham book, A Discourse concerning Church- 
communion [by A. Jeacocke], 1702, probably at his brother's stall. [Birming- 
ham Pub. Lib., Cat. of the Birmingham Collection, 1918, p. 792.] He was a 
noted boxer, and instructed his nephew Samuel in that art. [Boswell, ed. Hill, 
V. 229, n. 2 ; A. L. Reade, in Times Lit. Suppl., January 6th, 1921, p. ii.] 

JOHNSON (benjamin), bookseller in London, 1683. Brother of Michael and 
Andrew Johnson. Born at Cubley in 1658-9 ; apprenticed to Richard 
Simpson two years later than Michael, in 1675 ; took up his freedom in 1683, 
or two years before him. [A. L. Reade, in Times Lit. Suppl., January 6th, 
1921, p. II.] 

JOHNSON or JOHNSTON (ephraim), bookseller in Manchester, 1694-1701. 
He first appears as one of the publishers of an anonymous work entitled 
The doctrine oj the Church of England concerning the Lord's Day, 1695. [T.C. 
II. 548.] He published several controversial pamphlets. [R. W. Procter, 
Memorials of Manchester Streets, p. 183.] In 1700 he sold large numbers of 
school books and devotional works, which he purchased of John Minshull, 
bookseller, of Chester. [Library, 2nd. Ser., rv. 373-83.] He appears to have left 
Manchester by 1703, when Dunton says [p. 238] : " He was apprentice to 
Mr. Johnson of the same town, but his master thinking it necessary to be 
a knave, and as the consequence of it to walk off, so Mr. Clayton succeeds 
him, and has stepped into the whole business of that place, which is very 
considerable." 

JOHNSON ( J.), printer in London, 1700 (?). Printer of broadsides, amongst 
others A full and true discovery of all the Robberies, of tliat famous English 
Pyrate Capt. James Kelly . . . executed . . . lyoo. [b.m. 515. 1. 2 (786).]

JOHNSON— JOHNSTON. 173 

and Apology for the Six Deprived Bishops, 1690 ; (2) Murther upon Murther, 
printed for J. Johnson, near Fleet Street, 1703. His two addresses may 
describe the same house. 

JOHNSON (MICHAEL), bookseller in Lichfield, Uttoxeter, Ashby-de-la-Zouche, 
and Birmingham, 1685-1731. Celebrated as the father of Samuel Johnson. 
Bom in 1656, son of William Johnson, yeoman, of Cubley, Derbyshire, who 
removed to Lichfield and died there in or soon after 1663, and brother of 
Benjamin and Andrew Johnson {q. v.). In 1673 he was apprenticed to Richard 
Simpson, and in 1685 was made free of the Stationers' Company. The story in 
Bos well about his apprenticeship at Leek is apocryphal. He remembered in 
later years the great sale of Absalom and Achitophel. In 1687 he published a 
work, ^apfiaKo-Baaavo^, by Dr. Sir John Floyer of Lichfield, which was printed 
for him in London, "to be sold at his shops at Litchfield and Uttoxiter, in 
Staffordshire ; and Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in Leicestershire ". At Birmingham, 
and probably at Uttoxeter and Ashby-de-la-Zouch also, he opened his shop 
on market days only. He was a man of much learning, but " wrong headed, 
positive, and afflicted with melancholy," like his greater son, whom he also 
resembled in stature ; he was moreover unmethodical and kept no accounts. 
He embarked in the manufacture of parchment and lost his money, so that 
his later years were spent in increasing poverty. But he served many offices 
in the City of Lichfield, including Sheriff in 1709 and Senior Bailiff in 1725. 
He married, in 1706, Sarah Ford, of a Worcestershire family, and had two sons, 
Samuel, and Nathanael ; the latter died in early manhood. He died in Decem- 
ber 1731. His two brothers, Benjamin and Andrew, were also booksellers.

The King's printers, Bill, Hills and Newcombe, having printed the Declaration 
made by James II against the Prince of Orange, they were, on the accession 
of William, replaced by Edward Jones. Dunton [p. 324] speaks highly of his 
character, and adds " He has got a noble estate ' by authority ' and is 
deservedly famous for printing ' The True News ' and publishing the London 
Gazette ". In 1690 he had an office in Dublin. Jones died at his house at 
Kensington on Saturday the i6th February 1706, and was buried in 
Hampstead cemetery. Immediately on his decease there was published

JONES (JOHN), bookseller in Worcester and London ; London, (i) Dolphin and 
Crown, St. Paul's Churchyard ; (2) Bell, in St. Paul's Churchyard. 1681-99. 
Messrs. Burton & Pearson in their Bibliography of Worcestershire [n. 52] 
record Kedarminster Stuff, " London, printed for John Jones bookseller in 
Worcester, 1681." Jones, about 1697, opened a shop in London at the 
Dolphin and Crown in St. Paul's Churchyard, and in the following year issued 
a Sermon of Good Works by J. Jephcott, which has the imprint, " London, 
Printed for John Jones, Bookseller in Worcester and are to be sold at the 
Dolphin and Crown in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1698 ". The last two leaves of 
this volume contain a list of books printed for and sold by John Jones at the 
Dolphin & Crown in St. Paul's Churchyard. In 1699 his sign was the " Bell " 
in St. Paul's Churchyard. [T.C. ill. 150.] Probably identical with or son of 
the Jones who was a bookseller at Worcester in 1663. [Dictionary, 1641-67.] 

JONES (JOHN), bookseller in Oxford, 1702-25. Perhaps the same as " Jones 
senior," 1718-25, and also the London and Worcester bookseller of the name. 
[Madan, p. 31.] 

JONES (RICHARD), bookseller in London, (i) Jermin's Yard, Aldersgate Street ; 
(2) Golden Lion, Little Britain, near the Lame Hospital Gate ; (3) White

JONES (THOMAS), bookseller in London ; printer at Shrewsbury, 1676-1713. 
Bom at Corwen in 1847, he first practised the trade of a tailor in London.

Thomas Jones, 1676 ; also. Ex Nihilo Omnia : or, The Saints Companion, 
London, printed by J. Orme for Thomas Jones, 1692. In 1690 Jones also sold 
books printed in Welsh. [T.C. II. 298.] In or before 1696 he set up the first 
press at Shrewsbury. [Allnutt, p. 297.] 

JORDAN (j.), bookseller in London, Angel in Giltspur Street, without Newgate, 
1680-2. Publisher of several political broadsides at the time of the Popish

176 JOYNER— KEBLE. 

JOYNER ( ), printer in London, Giltspur Street, against St. Sepulchre's 
Back Gate, near West Smithfield, 1715. Advertised, in The British Weekly 
Mercury, November i6th-23rd, 17 15, Articles to promote Learning.

KADWELL ( ), bookseller in Milton, Kent, 1699. His name occurs in the 
advertisement in The Flying Post, December 2nd, 1699, of Edw. Brown's 
sermon preached at the Kentish Feast. It does not appear in the imprint to 
the book. The name was probably more often spelt Cadwell. 

KEAT (HUGH), bookseller in Evesham, 1678. He published in 1678 a ' Moral 
Interlude,' entitled ; A Traitor to himself, hyWiUiam Johns of Evesham, and the 
imprint runs, " Oxford, Printed by L. L. [i.e. Leonard Lichfield] and are to be 
sold by Edward Forrest, Booksellour in Oxford, and Hugh Keat, Booksellour 
in Evesham, 1678." [b.m. 644. e. 54.] R. Clavell was theLondon agent for this 
book. [T.C. I. 320.] Keat was no doubt a relative of William Keate (q. v.). 

KEATE (WILLIAM), bookseller in Stratford upon Avon, 1681-2. Evidently a 
relative of Hugh Keat of Evesham {q. v.). In Hil. 34-35 Charles II, Robert 
Clavell, the London bookseller, who was also agent for Hugh Keat, brought an 
action in the Court of Common Pleas, against William Keate of Stratford, to

first time in Mich. 1674 as the publisher of a translation from H. Grotius, 
entitled The Conciliation of Grace and Free-Will [T.C. i. 189], and from that 
time until 1709 he constantly entered books. In 1706 he published John 
Bowack's Second part of the Antiquities of Middlesex. [Harl. 5961 (128).] 



KEBLE— KEINTON. 177 

An engraved broadside catalogue of his publications survives, [b.m. 1865. c. 
3 (132).] Dunton [p. 297] has the following account of him : " Mr. Keble 
is a very ingenious, modest, humble man. ... He printed that useful book 
called A Week's Preparation for the Sacrament, and other excellent books of 
devotion." In 1704 he took his son William into partnership. In 1715 he 
was one of those receiving subscriptions for the third volume of Laurence 
Howel's Synopsis Canonum Ecclesice, which had been rewritten by the 
author, after the destruction of the original manuscript in Bowyer's fire in 
1713. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. I. 106.] 

KEBLE (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, Turk's Head, Fleet Street, 1704. 
Son of Samuel Keble {q. v.). In 1 704 he was in partnership with his father, and 
also published, with W. Freeman and J. Knapton, an edition of Euclid [T.C. 
in. 432], but the later reference to him given in Mr. Arber's Index to that 
volume is apparently a mistake for Samuel. [T.C. III. 650.] 

KEBLEWHITE ( ), bookseller in Newport, Isle of Wight, c. 1703. 
" Mr. Keblewite in the Isle of Wight has a good trade, considering the place, 
but that is not his whole dependence. He has been twice Mayor of the town, 
and is not only rich, but a grave and discreet Churchman." [Dunton, p. 237.] 

KEBLEWHITE (Stephen), see Kibblewhite. 

KEBLEWHITE, or KIBLEWAITE (w.), bookseller in London, Swan, or White 
Swan, St. Paul's Churchyard. 1694-1702. Dunton [p. 292] distinguishes 
this bookseller as " London (and sober) Kiblewaite ". Keblewhite made his 
first entr}'^ in the Term Catalogues in Hil. 169I with a book of divinity. [T.C. 
II. 490.] He was publisher for William King, Bishop of Londonderry. He 
is last heard of in 1702, when he advertised the second edition of Dr. James 
Keill's Anatomy of the Human Bodie. [T.C. m. 329.] 

KEIMER (s.), printer in London, 17 14. Printed for N. Clif! and D. Jackson. 

KEINTON (m.), bookseller in London, Rose, in St. Paul's Churchyard. 1678-82. 
A bookseller of this name was one of the publishers of a book called Of the 
Heart and its Right Sovereign. ... By J. T., advertised in 1678 and again in 
1682, and of Argumentum Anti-Normanicum. [T.C. I. 302, 496.] This may 
have been Matthew Keynton, who was at work in 1656 and who was then 
living at the Fountain in St. Paul's Churchyard. [Dictionary, 1641-67.] But 
the name may be a misprint for M[ary] Keirton {q. v.). 



178 KEIRTON— KETTILBY. 

KEIRTON (mary), bookseller in London, 1673. ^^ ^^^' ^^S- 1673, Mary 
Keirton assigned to Samuel Meame 151 copies. See also Keinton (M.).

Trimmers Confession of Faith. [b.M. C. 20. f . 2 (202).] He may have been a son 
of R. Kels [q.v. in Dictionary, 1641-67]. 

KELLINGTON (job), bookseller in London, Star in Little Britain, 1681 (?)-3. 
Publisher of the Works of the Rev. Isaac Ambrose in 1682 and of Walker's

KENNEDY (alex.), bookseller in Scotland (?) 1681. Three books of 
1681 " printed for A. Kennedy " are mentioned by Aldis, who says that they 
are probably Scottish. [Aldis, p. 115.] 

KENT (HUGH), bookseller in Evesham. An error [Haz. il. 317] for Hugh 
Keat {q.v.). 

KERSEY (JOHN), bookseller in London, The Rose in St. Paul's Oiurchyard,

cellaneous literature and also of Weekly Memorials for the Ingenious, or, 
An Account of Books lately set forth hi several languages. \T.C. I. 481.] This

S. Crouch. {T.C. I. 532.] Kersey either died or gave up business in 1686. 
and Faithome continued alone. Their place of business may have been on the 
site of the house in which George Thomason, the collector of the literature 
of the Revolution, once lived. See K. (j.). 

KETTILBY (Walter), bookseller in London, (i) Bishop's Head, in Duck Lane ; 
(2) St. Paul's Churchyard. 1669-1711. A noted publisher of divinity books. 
His first appearance in the Term Catalogues was in Mich. 1669, when his

was carrying on business both here and in St. Paul's Churchyard. [T.C. I. 58], 
but in 1671 he appears to have given up the Duck Lane premises. Dunton 



KETTLEWELL-KING. 179 

[p. 209] refers to him as " an eminent Episcopal bookseller ", and he published 
much learned literature, such as Isaac Barrow's Lectiones Octodecini \T.C. 1. 1 05] , 
and Henry More's Remarks upon two . . . Discourses. [T.C. 1. 228.] A list of his 
publications is found at the end of Dr. Charles Hickman's Sernwn preached 
before the . . . House oj Commons . . . igth October i6go. He was still publishing 
in May 1711. [T.C. m. 660.] 

KETTLEWELL (Robert), bookseller in London, (i) Hand and Sceptre over 
against St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet Street ; (2) Hand sind Sceptre, King 
Street, Bloomsbury. 1681-94. Probably a relative of the Rev. John Kettle- 
well, several of whose writings he published. He began as a publisher in 
i68i [T.C. 1. 448], and was for a time in partnership with R.Wells. Some time 
between 1686 and 1694 he moved to Bloomsbury; after the latter date 
nothing more is heard of him. [T.C. n. 166, 508, 519.] In Trin. 1688 he 
was defendant in a suit for trespass. [C.P.R. Trin. 4 Jas. II, Roll 3068, 
m. 187 r.] 

KIBBLEWHITE (STEPHEN), bookseller in Oxford, 1714-23. On April ist, 1716, 
Thomas Heame recorded that " Kibblewhyte a bookseller " was one of the 
unsuccessful candidates for the place of verger in the University. [Collections, 
V. 192.] He was at work in 1723. [Madan, p. 32.] 

KIBLEWAITE (w.), see Keblewhite. 

KIDGELL (JOHN), bookseller in London, (i) Atlas, Comhill ; (2) Golden Ball, 
Holbom, near Gray's Inn Gate. 1680-84. Dealer in law books ; publisher 
of Rights of the Kingdom. He moved to Holbom some time after 1682. His 
last entry in the Term Catalogues was in February 1684. [T.C. il. 6$.] 

KING (CHARLES), bookseller in London, Judge's Head, Westminster Hall, 
1707-25. His name appears for the first time in the Term Catalogues in Trin. 
1707 as one of the publishers of Francis Higgins's Sermon preach' d at White- 
hall on Ash Wednesday, i7of . [T.C. ill. 553.] A list of eight books published 
by him with Benjamin Barker is found in an Assize Sermon by J. A. Dubour- 
dieu, 1714. [Bodl. Sermons, 6 (13).] In 1713 Lintot bought of him a third 
share in Geddes's Tracts against Popery. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. viii. 298.] 
Charles King was still in business in 1725. The Mr. King mentioned by 
Dunton [p. 359] as succeeding him at the Black Raven in the Poultry about 
1698 may have been this man, but is more probably J. King. 

N 2 



i8o KING— KNAPLOCK. 

KING (GREGORY), bookseller in London. At the East Corner Piazza House of

of Chester [T.C. III. 193] and in 1703 Dr. William Howel's Elements of History. 
[T.C. III. 357.] It is doubtful whether he is the Mr. King who succeeded 
Dunton [q.v., p. 359] about 1698 at his shop in the Poultry. 

KINNEIR (d.), printer in Reading. Next door to the Saracen's Head, in High

was an edition of Juvenal and Persius, translated by Dryden, Congreve, 
Stepney, and Creech, in Mich. 1696. [T.C. II. 602.] Dunton [p. 216] says : " He 
printed Mr. Wesley's Defence of his Letter, &c., and then, to be sure, he is no 
Dissenter. However he is a very sober honest man, and has not one spot in his 
whole life, except it be the printing that malicious and infamous Pamphlet." 
He published many works in all classes of literature and held shares in the 
most important books. In or soon after 1 707 he moved or altered his sign to the 
Bishop's Head in St. Paul's Churchyard ; in that year he appears at the Angel 



KNAPTON— KNIGHT. i8i 

and Crown as part publisher with John Nicholson of Hickes's edition of the 
Works of 4 Kempis ; a list of publications is appended to vol. II. Also in 1707

KNAPTON (JAMES), bookseller in London, (i) Queen's Head, St. Paul's 
Churchyard ; (2) Crown, St. Paul's Churchyard. 1687-1738. This noted 
bookseller began, like many others, as a publisher of theological books, his first 
entry in the Term Catalogues being in Mich. 1687. Dunton [p. 295] spoke of 
him as " a very accomplished person . . . and shews by his purchasing Dampier's 
Voyages he knows how to value a good copy ". In 1688 he began to publish 
plays and novels in large numbers. It was in 1696 that he first advertised 
Dampier's Voyages. [T.C. 11. 609.] He held shares in all the most important 
books that were issued and carried on a flourishing business until his death in 
1738. He was Master of the Company of Stationers in 1 727 and again in 1 728, 
and was succeeded in business by two of his brothers, John and Paul. [Nichols,

of the New Exchange, Strand ; (2) Pope's Head in the Lower Walk of the 
New Exchange, Strand. 1684-90. In partnership with F. Saunders. They 
succeeded to the business of Henry Herringman in 1684 and were chiefly 
publishers of plays. Joseph Knight's name appears for the last time in the 
Term Catalogues in Easter 1690. [T.C. 11. 312.] 



i82 KNOWLES— LACEY. 

KNOWLES (THOMAS), bookseller and bookbinder (?) in London, Tower Street, 
1 682-1 700 (?). Published The Protestant Dissenters^ Case, a folio leaf. He may 
be identical with the Mr. Knowles noticed as a bookbinder by Dunton 
[p. 260] : " He is an ingenious and constant man at his Trade ; and bound 
for me that ' History of Living Men ' and ' Athenian Oracle ' which I lately 
dedicated and presented to the Prince of Denmark and Duke of Ormond 
with my own hand." 

KNOX (henry), bookseller in Edinburgh. In the Luckenbooths, " e regione 
insigniorum domini Ross ". 1696-1716. Probably youngest son of William

and guild brother of Edinburgh, 1678 ; minister of Bowden (transferred from 
Dunscore) about 1681 ; ejected by P, C. 1689. In 1696 he is found as a

The Clergy's Late Carriage to the King, printed for H. L. and I. K. [1688], 
[b.m. T. 100* (194).] 

L. (j.), printer in London, 1702. Printed in this year for Edward Evets (q.v.). 

L. (n.), bookseller in London, 1682. A pamphlet entitled The Charge of a Tory- 
Plot maintained, 1682, was printed for him and sold by R. Janeway.

Church. 1672-94. Began publishing in 1672, when he was joint publisher 
with Robert Pask of Edward Cocker's London Writing Master. [T.C. i. 120.] 



LADYMAN— LARKIN. 183 

In 1678 he published the first edition of the same author's Arithmctick. 
[T.C. I. 323,] Lacey was one of the agents for Bateman's " Scurvy Grass ", 
which he advertised in The Protestant {Domestick) Intelligence of February 24th, 
i6^-§. His name is not found in the Term Catalogues after Mich. 1684 ; but 
He published £n^Za«(i'5 GoWen Tr^asMry in 1694 (licensedatedi69i). [B.M.717. 
b. 55 (i).] Hazlitt [i. 91] records an edition of Cocker's Morals, printed for 
, Thomas Lane, 1675. This is apparently an entirely different edition from that 
in the British Museum with the same date, which has the imprint, " London, 
Printed by W. D. for T. D. at the Ship in St. Mary Axe, and T. L. at the 
Golden Lyon near the Meal Market in South war k stationer." The tenant of 
the Golden Lion in Southwark was Lacy, and we suspect the Thomas 
Lane referred to by Hazlitt to be a misreading for Thomas Lacy. At the same 
time it is clear from the collation that Hazlitt's copy of Cocker's Morals 
belonged to an entirely different edition. The possibility of a misreading of the 
imprint is strengthened by the fact that in the very next entry Hazlitt records 
a copy of Cocker's Arithmetick, with the name of Thomas Law, at the Golden 
Lion in Southwark, where a reference to the book itself shows that it is 
printed by Thomas Lacy. 

LADYMAN ( ), bookseller in London, near the Bars at Aldgate, 1691. His 
name occurs on a sale catalogue of 1691 as one of those from whom copies 
might be obtained, [b.m. 821. i. 9 (26).] 

LAMBERT (richard), bookseller at York, Crown, (a) at, {b) within the Minster 
Gate. See Dictionary, 1641-67. Working in 1686. He was succeeded by 
Robert Clarke, who married Susannah Lambert, probably his daughter, in 
1690. 

LANE (JOHN), bookseller in London, Blue Anchor in Wild Street, 1688. His 
imprint occurs in a pamphlet by A. Pulton, Sonie Reflections upon tJie Author 
and Licenser of . . . The Missioner^s Arts discovered, [b.m. T. 1839 (3).] 

LANE (THOMAS), see Lacey. 

LARKIN (GEORGE), senior, bookseller and printer in London, (i) Two Swans 
without Bishopsgate ; (2) Kings Head in Wood Street ; (3) Lower end of 
Broad Street, next to London Wall ; (4) Coach and Horses without Bishops- 
gate ; (5) Hand Alley, Bishopsgate Street. 1666-1706. The following may 
be substituted for the brief account of Larkin given in Dictionary, 1641-67. 



i84 LARKIN— LAWSON. 

George Larkin was bom about the year 1642. He began publishing and per- 
haps also printing in 1666, when he issued Bunyan's Grace Abounding, and 
also many things which gave offence to the Government. In the proceedings 
which took place before the Committee of the House of Lords in 1676, Roger 
Norton deposed that in 1668 he searched Larkin's house and found there copies 
of two notorious pamphlets, The Cobbler of Gloucester and Advice to a Painter. 
Larkin's name does not appear in the Term Catalogues until Easter 1683, 
when he printed two books on Uniformity for Edm, Hickeringill, [T.C. II, 20.] 
He afterwards became the intimate friend of Dunton, who makes many 
effusive references to him in his Life and Errors and other \vritings. To quote 
from one [p. 245], " Mr. Larkin has been my acquaintance for 20 years 
and was the first printer I had in London . . . and has lately published an 
ingenious essay on the Noble Art and Mystery of Printing . . . Mr. Larkin has 
a son now living of the same name and trade with himself." George Larkin's 
age is given by Dunton [p. 441] as 64 in 1706 ; but the date of his death is 
unknown. 

LARKIN (GEORGE), junior, printer in London, Bishopsgate Street, 1703-24. 
Son of George Larkin, sen. Mentioned by Dunton [p. 250] ; also in Negus's 
List of Printers, 1724, as one of those well affected to King George. 

LAW (THOMAS), see Lacey. 

LAWRENCE (JOHN), bookseller in London, Angel in the Poultry, 1681-1711. 
A noted Presbyterian bookseller. His first entry in the Term Catalogues was 
J. Houghton's Collection of Letters for the Improvement of Husbandry and 
Trade . . . Mich. 1681. {T.C. I. 464.] He shared with Dunton the publication 
of Lord Delamere's Works, Mackenzie's Narrative of the Siege of Londonderry , 
and Baxter's Life. Dunton calls him " an upright honest Bookseller ... so 
exact in Trade as to mark down ever}' book he sells ". He married a daughter 
of the Rev. — Roswell. [Dunton, p. 205.] He was still in business in 1711. 
[T.C. m. 673.] 

LAWSON (JOSEPH), bookseller in Lincoln, at the Bail, 1681-9. Publisher 
of Selden's Of the Judicature of Parliament ; advertised in the Term Catalogue 
for Easter 1681, a sermon preached in Lincoln Cathedral on July i8th, 1681, by 
the Rev. Daniel Nicols, and A General Discourse of Simony, by the Rev. J. Met- 
ford, 1682, John Ineth's Guide to the Devout Christian, 1687, and Dr. Brevint's 
Christian Sacrament and Sacrifice, 1689. \T.C. I. 443, 470, 509 ; n. 205, 263.] 



LAYCOCK— LEACH. 185 

LAYCOCK (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, 1696 (?)-i 703 (?). Married 
(Susannah ?) daughter of William Miller {q. v.), and carried on the latter's 
collection of " stitched books ". [Dunton, p. 213.] A sale catalogue of the 
collection was compiled for him at an unknown date by Charles Tooker. 

LEA (PHILIP), bookseller in London, (i) Atlas and Hercules, Poultry, (a) in 
Cheapside, {b) right against the Old Jewry ; (2) Westminster Hall, next the 
Common Pleas. 1683-99 (?) In addition to selling books Philip Lea was also 
a maker of globes and dealer in maps. His name first appears in the Term 
Catalogues in Trin. 1683. [T.C. 11. 30.] In 1685 he sold an edition of Euclid 
[T.C. U. 136], and in 1692 An Epitome of the Whole Art of War. [T.C. II. 394.] 
His last appearance is a comprehensive advertisement of books, maps, globes, 
and instruments, in Trin. 1699 [T.C. in. 140-1] ; the date of his death is 
unknown, but his widow continued to carry on the business until 1703. 
[T.C. III. 382.] 

LEABOURN (elias), bookseller in London, 1680. His name occurs in the 
imprint to a broadside on the Popish Plot entitled Reynard's Doionfall, 1680. 
[B.M. C. 20. f. 6 (8).] 

LEACH (dryden), printer in London, Elliot's Court, Little Old Bailey, 
1707-24. Son and successor to Francis Leach {q. v.), and cousin of Swift 
and, presumably, of Dryden. Swift speaks of him several times contemp- 
tuously in the Journal to Stella. He procured him the printing of Harrison's 
Tatler in January i7yxj ^"^ ^ month later Leach lost it. Swift tells us that 
he was known as printer of the Postman, that he had acted Oroonoko, that he 
married Mrs. Baby Aires of Leicester, and that he was a coxcomb. [Swift, 
Prose Works, ii.. Journal to Stella, 1900, pp. 40, 99, 103, 112.] In 1713 Leach 
subscribed three guineas to the Bowyer fund. In 1724 Negus classed him 
among the printers well affected to King George. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. I. 
62, 312.] 

LEACH (FRANCIS), printer in London, Elliot's Court, Little Old Bailey, 
1673-1707. By some oversight, this printer, who was in all probability a son 
of the Francis Leach, printer, who died in 1658, is not mentioned in the list 
of printers taken in 1675. He was well known to John Dunton, who gives 
[p. 247] a rather foolish description of him, from which we may extract what 
follows : " He is . . . blest with ... a constant trade ; has printed The Postman, 
&c., many years ; and I may venture to say, that Francis Leach is the 



i86 LEACH— LEE. 

handsomest Printer in London." His son Dryden {q. v.) succeeded him in 
1707, the Postman for July ist being the first with his imprint. 

LEACH (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, Crown, Comhill, near the Stocks 
Market, 1678-91. First appears as a publisher in 1678 [T.C. I. 308, 310, 314] 
with E, Cooke's tragedy Love's Triumph and other books. He made his last 
entry in 1683. [T.C. II. 25.] He died intestate in 1691, administration being 
granted to his principal creditor, Richard Hewson, [P.C.C. Admons, Jan. 1691.] 

LEAKE (JOHN), bookseller and printer in London, Crown, Fleet Street, between 
the Two Temple Gates, 1673-1717 (?). Son of William Leake, with whom he 
was in partnership until 1679, when William's name appears in the Term 
Catalogue for the last time. [T.C. I. 363.] John Leake then appears to 
have set up as a printer, and between 1681 and 1693 printed for Awnsham 
Churchill, Jonathan Greenwood, Arthur Jones, Luke Meredith, Benjamin 
Needham, and Abel Swalle. [Haz. 1. 432 ; II. 67, 553, 592, 646 ; ni. 125, 233.] 
He was in all probability the Mr. Leake who in 17 13 subscribed to the 
Bowyer relief fund ; he may also be the person mentioned by Dunton [p. 292] 
as " humble Leek ", and the J. L. who printed Stemhold and Hopkins for

LEE (SAMUEL), lx)okseller in London and Dublin ; London, Feathers, Lombard 
Street, (a) near Pope's Head Alley, {b) over against the Post House. 1677-95. 
Began publishing in 1677, when he brought himself into notice as the compiler 
and publisher of the earliest known London Directory, A Collection of the 
names of the Merchants in and about the City of London. It was a small octavo, 
issued at a shilling, and was entered in the Registers of the Company of 
Stationers by Daniel Major, stationer, on Lee's behalf, the latter not being a 
freeman of the Company. Major was joint pubUsher of the work, which was 
advertised in the Term Catalogue for Mich., Lee's name appearing first. [T.C.l. 
294.] That the copyright was his is proved by the fact that on November 26th, 
1677, a warrant was passed for a grant to him of the sole rights of publication 
for fourteen years. [S. P. Dom. Entry Book, 334, p. 439.] At the time of the 



LEIGH— LENTHALL. 187 

Popish Plot he published several broadsides, and in Trin. 33, Chas. II [1681-2] 
Henry Hills brought an action against him in the Court of Common Pleas for 
slander in saying that there was a principal member of the Stationers' Com- 
pany who had sent for a Dutch printing-press and letters and printed treason- 
able and seditious books, and upon being pressed declaring it was Mr. Hills the 
King's Printer. Hills claimed £1,000 damages. [C.P.R. 2993, Trin. 33, Chas. II. 
m. 508 recto.] This is Dunton's character of Samuel Lee [p. 214] : " Such 
a Pirate, such a Cormorant was never before. Copies, Books, Men, Shops, all 
was one, he held no propriety, right or wrong, good or bad, till at last he began 
to be known, and the booksellers not enduring so ill a man among them to 
disgrace them, spewed him out, and off he marched for Ireland where he 
acted as felonious-Lee as he did in London." Lee's name is found for the last 
time in the Term Catalogues in Hil. 1684. [T.C. 11. 65.] In Dublin he issued 
an edition of The Present State of Europe, 1693, ^"^ ^"^ °f Dionysius Syrus'

LINDSAY— LINTOT. 189 

LINDSAY (david), printer in Edinburgh, in the Grassmarket at the foot of 
Heriot's Bridge, 1681-5. Watson [p. 14] thus relates the history of thb 
press : " Sir Thomas Murray of Glendoick, having carefully digested the Acts 
of Parliament . . . imploy'd John Caims, Bookseller in Edinburgh, . . . and he 
brought Dutch workmen and materials from Holland for that purpose. The 
Dutch-men's names were Josuah van Solingen and Jan Colmar. Mr. Caims 
dying in a short time after they came here, the Dutch-men kept the house 
a going, and printed the folio Acts of ParUament in 1681. This printing- 
house, becoming at last the Dutch-men's in property ; and Mrs. Anderson 
endeavouring to stop their working by her gift ; David Lindsay, merchant in 
Edinburgh obtain'd a gift from King Charles II . . . and for his protecting 
them with his gift; they give him a share of their printing house ; he and 
they printed several books very neatly, under all their names. . . and at last 
the Dutch-men purchased Mr. Lindsay's gift, and bought back his share of the 
printing-house. These Dutch-men falling into very considerable debts, by the 
purchasing of this printing-house, and the ill payment of most of their 
employers ; James Watson . . . paid money for them . . . and they made over 
the printing-house to him " — and seem to have entered into his employ. The 
printing privilege prefixed to the Acts of 1681, renews to David Lindsay as 
undertaker, and John Caims as printer, the privilege granted to Sir Thomas 
Murray in 1679 ; it was confirmed by the Privy Council, March 31st, 1681. 
Lindsay was appointed one of the King's printers November 23rd, 1682. 
The succession of imprints at this house was as follows : 1681-3, Lindsay. 
1682-4, Lindsay and his partners. 1682, Solingen. 1682-5, Solingen and 
Colmar. 1683, Lindsay, Kniblo, Solingen, and Colmar. 1684, Kniblo, 
Solingen, and Colmar. 1685, Colmar. 1685, Colmar and Gunter. [Aldis, 
p. n6.] Lindsay's advertisement, c. 1681, exists. [b.m. Cup. 651. e. (82.)] 

LINDSEY (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, Angel, near Lincoln's Inn, 1694-6. 
Published weekly an intemational critical journal, entitled Miscellaneous 
Letters. If we may believe Dunton [p. 229], Lindsey was born to a good 
estate, and after trading for a few years, retired into the country. 

LINTOT, or LINTOTT (barnaby Bernard), bookseller in London, (i) Cross 
Keys in St. Martin's Lane, 1698 ; (2) Post Office, in the Middle Temple Gate 
in Fleet Street, 1701-4 ; (3) Cross Keys (and Crown), (a) between the two 
Temple Gates in Fleet Street, {b) next Nando's Coffee House, Temple Bar, 



I90 LINTOT. 

1709-36. 1698-1736. This eminent publisher was bom at Southwater, 
Horsham, on December ist, 1675. He was the son of John Lintot yeoman 
and was probably a nephew of the Joshua Lintot who was printer to the 
House of Commons between 1708 and 1710. Bernard Lintot was bound 
apprentice to Thomas Lingard in December 1690, was afterwards turned over 
to John Harding, and became a freeman of the Company in March 1699. 
In 1698 his name appears on the imprints of Crowne's Caligula and Vanbrugh's 
Relapse. He married on October 13th, 1700. He very soon became noted 
as the publisher of poems and plays by Farquhar, Fen ton, Gay, Pamell, 
Pope, Steele, and other famous authors. In 171 2 he published Micellaneous 
Poetns and Translations by several hands, in opposition to Tonson's Miscellany ; 
it contained the first version of The Rape oj the Lock. In 1713 Lintot was the 
highest bidder for the copyright of Pope's Iliad, and became proprietor. 
The first volume appeared on June 6th, 1715, the last in 1720. Owing to the 
appearance in Holland of a pirated duodecimo edition, Lintot was robbed of 
much of his expected profit, being compelled to issue a similar cheap edition 
in this country. For the Odyssey, which he published in 1725-6, Lintot agreed 
to pay Pope £600, and to supply free of charge copies for Pope's subscribers. 
Pope insisted that free copies should also be sent to the subscribers found by 
Broome. This led to a quarrel, and Pope pilloried Lintot in The Dunciad, and 
elsewhere. During the severe frost of 1715-16 Lintot was one of those who 
set up stalls on the frozen Thames. After the accession of George I he was 
appointed one of the printers of the Parliamentary votes, and kept this office 
until 1727. Lintot took his son Henry into business in 1730. He died on 
February 3rd, 1736, and his will, made in 1730, was proved on February 14th, 
by his son. Lintot served the office of renter warden of the Company of 
Stationers in 1 715, and in 1729 and 1 730 was under-warden. He is described by 
Swift as large and fair in person and character ; Young says that he was 
choleric. Pope gives an amusing account [Letter cxx, ed. 1730] of Lintot's 
conversation, in which the latter reveals his arts in managing translators and 
correctors and critics of tongues unknown to himself. He was noted for 
posting up the titles of his new books, printed in red. {D.N.B., T.C., &c.] 

LINTOT (JOSHUA), bookseller in London, New Street, near St. Martin's Lane, 
in the Fields, 1708-9. Probably uncle of Bernard Lintot, with whom he

o 



194 M. (T.)— MAJOR. 

M. (t.), bookseller in London, 1678. These initials, which are found in conjunc-

She was then at London House Yard. Dunton speaks of her kindly in 
1703 in his Life and Errors, and as if she was then newly set up in business, 
and she published the book two years later ; but by 1706 he had quarrelled 
with her. He accuses her of slandering him in The Wandering Spy ; she 
attached his goods for debt, and he abused her violently in The Whipping 
Post, 1706, calling her "a hedge-publisher", "the famous publisher of 
Grub-street News ", &c. He says that she was a bookseller's daughter.

196 MALTHUS— MAPLESDEN. 

MALTHUS (THOMAS), bookseller in London, Sun, in the Poultry, 1682-1700 (?). 
Appears for the first time in the Term Catalogue of Mich. 1682, as the 
publisher of a Life of the Duke of Monmouth. \T.C. I. 506,] During 1684 
he issued many books, including a cheap abridgement of Exquemelin's 
History of tJie Bucaniers and several medical works. In 1685, when Dunton 
was setting out on his voyage to America, he met Malthus at Gravesend,on his 
way to Holland, " his circumstances being something perplexed ". In 
another passage Dunton refers to Malthus as " very unfortunate ". His

periodical called The Balm of Gilead. [Lit. Anecd. viii. 494.] 

MEAD (DANIEL), bookseller in London, Bible, Snow Hill, by the George Inn 
Gate, 1707-32. Possibly related to the Rev. Matthew Mead, for whom he

Britain, and in 1683 with A, Meame, probably his mother, advertising the 
two volumes of John Nelson's Impartial Collection of the Great Affairs of State.

took subscriptions for Ray's General History of Plants. In the same year he 
was one of the partners in the works of Sir Thomas Browne, and this is his last 
appearance. He seems never to have published alone, but always to have 
taken shares in large ventures. He has often been held to be a binder, like 
his father ; but Mr. Gordon Duff [Edinb. Bibl. Soc. Trans, xi. 47] shows that 
no bindings can be attributed with any probability to him. 

MEARNE (SAMUEL), see Dictionary, 1641-67.

Robert Fary ; he was also the printer of The Daily Post and The British

[T.C. II. 358.] He married a daughter of Richard Royston, and some time 
during 1686-7 moved to the Angel, the premises of his father-in-law, who

Dunton [p. 254] wrote of him thus : " Mr. Merreal at the Rose in Bread Street. 
He is rich, yet very humble. He has been put up for SherifE ... He was the 
first Stationer I ever dealt with [i. e. about 1681] ; and in trading with him 
for twenty years I ever found him just and kind. It is a question whether he

cupied by Richard Chiswell, and made their first entry in the Term Catalogues 
in Mich. 1698. Leigh dropped out of the partnership in 1704, and Midwinter 
moved to the Three Crowns between 1706 and 1708. Dunton speaks of 
them as doing a " topping business ", and there is no doubt that they were 
two of the largest booksellers of the day, holding shares in most of the chief 
undertakings. The date of Midwinter's death is unknown. He was still 
publishing in 1725, and was succeeded by his son Daniel 11. 

MIDWINTER (EDWARD), bookseller and printer in London, Star, Pye Comer, 
1710-25. His first known publication is The Northamptonshire Wonder,

MILBOURN— MILLER. 205 

Crusoe, 1722 [Gent] and in 1724 [Esdaile, p. 208; Haz. II. 362, 710] ; but 
his circumstances were so poor that Gent records that on one occasion, 
apparently in 1723, he was obHged to remove himself and family to a place 
called the Mint, a district in Southwark which was then a sanctuary for 
insolvent debtors. [Da vies, York Press, p. 158.] Midwinter is mentioned in 
Negus's list of printers as a " high-flyer ". [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. 1. 31 1.] He mar-

judgement at the next sessions, for printing a libel, [b.m. 515. 1. 2 (148).] 

MILBOURN (E.), printer in London, 1684. See Milboum (A.). 

MILBOURN (THOMAS), printer in London, Jewin Street, 1659-86. See Dictionary,

seller (q. v.), " near £10,000 deep ", and issued a catalogue of the books in 
February i68| [b.m. 821. i. 13 (i)] ; but he, " with his auctioneering, atlases, 
and projects, failed " for £30,000 or more in 1690, and ruined Scott, to whom 
he could not pay the purchase money, and also his relative, Moses Pitt. He 
became a debtor in the Fleet. [Roger North, Lives of Francis Norths &c., III.

MILLER (jOHN),bookbinder in Edinburgh, c. 1674. Will registered January 21st, 
1675. [Bann. Misc. II. 296 ; Aldis, p. 117.] 

MILLER (JOHN), bookseller in Sherborne and Yeovil, 1691-1709. Local 
publisher or agent for the sale of sermons, &c., by Dorsetshire and Somerset- 
shire divines, also published in London. His name appears in seven such 
entries between the dates given, a shop at Yeovil being also mentioned in one 
of 1697. [T.C. II. 379 ; ni. 35, 210, 386, 425, 582, 611 ; the last is b.m. 225. 
h. 3 (3).] 

MILLER (SIMON), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

MILLER (SUSANNAH), bookseller in London, The Acorn, in St. Paul's Church- 
yard, 1698 (.?)-i7oo. Probably daughter of William Miller {q. v.). 

MILLER (wnxiAM), bookseller in London, Gilded Acorn, St. Paul's Church- 
yard, 1661-96 (?). See Dictionary, 1641-67. Dunton [p. 213] says of him : 
" He . . . was blessed with a great memory, which he employed for the good 
of the publick ; for he had the largest collection of stitched books of any maji 
in the world, and could furnish the Clergy (at a dead lift) with a printed 
sermon on any text or occasion. His death was a public loss, and will never 
be repaired unless by his ingenious son-in-law, Mr. William Laycock, who 
I hear is making a general collection of stitched books ; and as Mr. Miller's 
stock was all put into his hands, perhaps he is the fittest man in London to 
perfect such a useful undertaking." A sale catalogue (without date) of 
this stock of pamphlets was afterwards compiled by Charles Tooker for 
Laycock. [b.m. 620. a. i (i).] Miller advertised largely in the Term Catalogues, 
and also generally added an advertisement at the end of his imprints. For 
example, the imprint to the second edition of Captain George St. Lo's England! s 
Safety, 1693, runs thus : " London : Printed for W. Miller, at the Gilded 
Acorn in St. Paul's Churchyard, where gentlemen and others may be furnished 
with Bound Books of most sorts. Acts of ParHament, Speeches and other 
sorts of Discourses, and State Matters ; as also Books of Divinity, Church 
Government, Humanity, Sermons on most occasions, &c." A list of his books 
is to be found in this book. It is the last entered in his name in the Term 
Catalogues. The exact date of his death is unknown, but his business was 



MILLET— MILLION. 307 

carried on for some time by Susannah Miller, probably the daughter mentioned 
by Dunton, who married William Laycock. 

MILLET (JOHN), printer in London, 1683-92. In partnership with M. Haley. 
They printed large numbers of ballads, broadsides, and chap-books for 
various booksellers. 

MILLINGTON (edward), bookseller and book-auctioneer in London, (i) Peli- 
can, Duck Lane; (2) Bible, Little Britain; and in Cambridge. 1670-1703. 
Made his first entry in the Term Catalogues as a publisher of books in Easter 
1670, when he published William Seaman's Gratnmatica linguae Turcicae. 
{T.C. 1. 31.] It was, however, as a book-auctioneer that he became famous. 
Dunton [pp. 235-6] calls him " the famous Mr. Edward Millington ", and 
" a man of remarkable elocution, wit, sense, and modesty ", and adds : " He 
was originally a bookseller, which he left off, being better cut out for an 
auctioneer ; he had a quick wit, and a wonderful fluency of speech. There 
was usually as much comedy in his ' Once, Twice, Thrice,' as can be met 
with in a modern play : * Where ', said Millington, ' is your generous flame for 
learning ? Who but a sot or blockhead, would have money in his pocket, and 
starve his brains ? ' Though I suppose he had but a round of jests. Dr. C. 
once bidding too leisurely for a book, says Millington, * Is this your Primitive 
Christianity ? ' alluding to a book the honest Doctor had published under that 
title. ... He died in Cambridge, and I hear they bestowed an elegy on his 
memory and design to raise a monument to his ashes." Ned Ward, in A Step 
to Stirbitch-fair, gives a similar description of Millington's humour as an 
auctioneer. He was the chief auctioneer of the time. [b.m. Catalogue of Sale 
Catalogues.] He was holding auctions at Cambridge, in the town itself, 
at the Eagle and Child, opposite St. Benet's, and at Stourbridge Fair, as 
early as 1686. [Mayor, Catnbridge under Queen Anne, pp. 249, 492.] He died 
in 1703. [Timperley, p. 588.] 

MILLION (henry), bookseller in London, (i) Bible, Fleet Street ; (2) Bible, 
Old Bailey. 1670-79. Believed to be the son of John Million, 9. v., Dictionary, 
1641-67. His first entries in the Term Catalogues were Cornelius Agrippa's 
Female Pre-eminence and Herbert Palmer's Memorials oj Godliness and 
Christianity, Mich. 1670, and his last Moses Rusden's FuU Discovery oJ Bees, 
1679. [T.C. I. 57, 60, 373.] He was in Fleet Street in 1675 [T.C. I. 203], 
and had moved to the Old Bailey by 1679. All his few books were cheap. 



2o8 MILLS— MONCKTON. 

MILLS (f,), bookseller in London, Rose and Crown without Temple Bar, 1696. 
In partnership with W, Turner. Their names are found in the imprint to 
Le Maire's Voyages to the Canary Islands, 1696. 

MILLS (RICHARD), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

MILNER (JACOB or james), bookseller in Dublin, Essex Street, 1692-1701. 
The name " Jacob Milner " is first met in 1692 and again in 1693. In 1697 
" J. Milner " published Bishop John Steame's Tractatus de Visitatione 
Infirmorum. \T.C. III. 27.] The will of " James Milner " was proved in 1701. 
All these probably relate to the same man. 

MILWARD (EDWARD), bookseller in Lichfield, 1680. He sold John Brinley's 
Discovery of the Impostures of Witches and Astrologers, London, printed 
for John Wright, 1680. [Haz. II. 62.] 

MINIKIN (GEORGE), (?) stationer in London, King's Head in St. Martin's, 
1676. Sold a pack of cards representing the counties of England. [T.C. i. 237.] 

MINSHULL (JOHN), bookseller in Chester, Bridge Street, 1674 (?)-i7i2. 
Doubtless related to the William Minshall or Minshull who was carrying on 
business in Chester in the days of the Commonwealth. [Dictionary, 1641-67.] 
From certain Chancery Proceedings we learn that John Minshull was appren- 
ticed to a London bookseller, Peter Bodvell, and afterwards purchased his 
freedom from the Company of Stationers of Chester and set up in business for 
himself about the year 1674. Books published by him in 1682 and 1698 are 
recorded in J. Cooke's Bibliotheca Cestriensis. He sold school-books wholesale 
to booksellers and stationers in various places, amongst his customers being 
Ephraim Johnson of Manchester. According to Timperley he died in 1712. 

MINSHULL (r.), bookseller in Chester, Bridge Street, 1712. Son of John 
Minshull. In 1699 he was a student at Trinity College, Dublin, where 
Dunton visited him [p. 625]. He probably joined his father soon after this, 
and succeeded him in 171 2. He is given in a list of provincial booksellers in 
iV. 6r Q. [loth Ser., V. 142.] 

MITCHELL (j.), bookseller in London, Threadneedle Street, 1686. Sold the

MONCKTON (PHILIP), bookseller in London, Star, in St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1 701-7. A publisher of divinity, which is probably why Dunton [p. 292] 



MONCUR— MOORE. 209 

refers to him as " Church-Unity Monckton ". Made the first and last 
of his many entries in the Term Catalogues in 1701 and 1707. [T.C. Ul. 
263,537-] 

MONCUR (JOHN), printer in Edinburgh, his printing house at the foot of the 
Bull Close, opposite to the Tron, 1709-12 ; his house and shop at the Head 
of the Bank-Close, in the Lawn-market, 1726, 1707-26. In 1709 he printed 
The Scots Postman, and in 1712 The Evening Post. On page viii of the edition 
of Guthrie's Christian's Great Interest which Moncur published in 1726 is a 
list of twenty-nine books printed and sold by him. 

MONEY (JOHN), bookseller in London, 1681. Defendant in an action for

MONTGOMERY (hugh), bookseller in London, Comhill, 1703. Only known 
from Dunton, who says [p. 269], " He was bom a Scotsman and served 
his time with Andrew Bell," and tells us that he was " of a low stature '* 
and that he himself thought so highly of him that he entmsted him with the 
sale of the whole impression of his Idea of a New Life, i. e. Life and Errors* 

MOORE, or MORE (thomas), bookseller in London, Maidenhead, over against 
St. Dunstan's Church in Fleet street, 1678-84. Publisher of John Wallis's

2IO MORDEN— MORPHEW. 

MORDEN (CHARLES), bookseller in Cambridge, 1678-89, Son of William 
Morden, bookseller {q. v.) who in his will, March 4th, 1678, left him " all books 
bound and in quires which I have in Cambridge and those in London and also 
all my debts " as well as the " Freehold tenement . . . wherein I now dwell . . . 
in the parish of St. Michael's," &c. We find his name on two works, the 
third edition of R. Sheringham's The King's Supremacy Asserted, 1682, along 
with Jonas Hart {q. v.) a relative, and on Beaufrons, 1684. He was buried 
February 28th, i68|. [Gray & Palmer, 118, 119.] 

MORDEN (ROBERT), engraver, printer, and bookseller in London, near the Royal 
Exchange, 1671-1702. An engraver of maps, charts, prints, playing cards 
etc., who not only printed his productions but sold them. [T.C. I. 10.] His 
advertisement first appeared in the Term Catalogue of Trin. 1671 [2\C. i. 80], 
and he was still in business in 1702. 

MORDEN (wnxiAM), bookseller in Cambridge, 1652-79. See Dictionary, 
1641-67. In his will dated that year [Gray & Palmer, p. 118] he leaves his 
business, the freehold house he lived in, along with other bequests, to his son 
Charles {q. v.). In 1661 he subscribed £4 towards the Free and Voluntary 
Gift to his Majesty, being the largest amount given by a bookseller. Amongst 
the books published by him are the Philosophical Works oj Henry More, 
1662, editions of J. Ray's Proverbs, 1670, 1678, John Smith's Select Discourses, 
1673, &c. 

MORPHEW (JOHN), bookseller in London, near Stationers' Hall, 1706-20 (?). 
Publisher of political pamphlets, State trials, news-sheets and novels, and one 
of the principal booksellers of the period. Morphew made his first entry in the 
Term Catalogues in Mich. 1706, with a shilling book on the war. \T.C. III. 522.] 
He appears to have set up in the premises previously occupied by John Nutt. 
On October 12th of that year he issued the first number of The Country- 
Gentletnan's Courant. He issued the first number as an advertisement 
without charge. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. rv. 82.] Early in 1707 he issued 
Mercurius Oxoniensis, or. The Oxford Intelligencer, by M. G,, and in the 
same year The Monthly Miscellany. Apart from novels and ephemeral 
tracts he published much interesting literature. In the Journal to Stella, 
December 13th, 171 1, Dean Swift wrote, " I forgot to tell you that the printer 
told me yesterday that Morphew the publisher was sent for by that Lord Chief 
Justice [the Earl of Macclesfield], who was a manager against Sacheverell, 



MORTIER— MORTLOCK. six 

he showed him two or three papers and pamphlets, among the rest mine of the 
Conduct of the Allies, threatened him, asked him who was the author, and has 
bound him over to appear next term." Morphew was still publishing in 1720, 
when he issued a second volume of novels by Mrs. Manley. [Esdaile, p. 266.] 

MORTIER (david), bookseller in London, Erasmus's Head, in the Strand, 
1701. Published, with John Smith and Edward Cooper, C. Le Brun's 
Conference upon Expression, a work illustrated with many engraved plates. 
[b.m. 1403. d. 48.] 

MORTLOCK, or MORTLAK (g.), bookseller in London, 1670-1717. See 
Mortlock (Henry). 

MORTLOCK, or MORTLACK (henry), bookseller in London, (i) Phoenix, 
in St. Paul's Churchyard ; (2) White Hart, in Westminster Hall. 1660-1709. 
See Dictionary, 1641-67. The first of the above addresses was undoubtedly 
Henry Mortlock's principal place of business, as the stalls in Westminster 
Hall were only open during term time and were liable to be cleared away in the 
event of a State trial or other public function. Henry Mortlock is first met 
with as a publisher in the Term Catalogue of Easter 1670, when he advertised 
Phineas Fletcher's Father's Testament as on sale at the White Hart in West- 
minster Hall. [T.C. I. 29.] At this time he had a relative, G. Mortlock, 
in partnership with him, and a list of books sold by them at both their shops 
is found at the end of Joseph Glanvill's Essays, 1676. Dunton has [p. 286] 
the following note upon Henry Mortlock : " Mr. Mortlack has been Master of 
the Company of Stationers, and the most indefatigable shop-keeper I have 
known. He is very exact in trade. He was much assisted by the great 
Doctor Stillingfleet Bishop of Worcester, and printed [i. e. published] most 
of his works. He is now pretty much up in years, speaks slow, but speaks 
seldom in vain." He was one of the most prolific publishers of the time. 
The last entry under his name in the Term Catalogues is in 1 709. [T.C. lih 356.] 
The date of his death is unknown. G. Mortlock was still in business in 171 7, 
when he pubUshed Anthony Blackwall's Introduction to the Classics. [Nichok, 
Lit. Anecd. I. 133.] John Mortlock, of Nottingham and Newark {q. v.) was 
no doubt a relative. 

MORTLOCK (JOHN), bookseller in Nottingham and Newark, 1695. Doubtless 
a relative of H. and G. Mortlock of London (q. v.), as amongst the books sold

by him was An Explanation of the Additional Rules for the Genders of Nouns 
in the Oxford Grammar, " by John Twells, Master of the Free School in 
Newark. London, Printed for Hen. Mortlock . . . and sold by John Mortlock 
bookseller in Nottingham, and at his shop in Newark, 1695." 

MORY (EDWARD), bookseller in London, Three Bibles in St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1695-9, Chiefly a publisher of divinity. He made his first entry in the Term 
Catalogues in Mich. 1691, and his last in Easter 1699. \T.C. n. 378 ; III. 128.] 

MOSMAN (GEORGE), bookseller and printer in Edinburgh, (a) his shop on the 
South Side of the Parliament Close ; {b) his printing house in Hart's Close, 
over against the Trone-Church. 1669 (.'*)-i 707 or 1708. May be identical 
with the George Mosman, merchant, who was fined £200 (Scots) by the Privy 
Council on March 8th, 1669, for being at a conventicle, and who in 1685 
was again before the Privy Council for a similar offence. In 1690 George 
Mosman acquired the printing house of the Society of Stationers, in which he 
had been a partner, and commenced printing on his own account. In this 
year he published sermons preached before the King's Commissioner by 
Gilbert Rule and David Williamson ; the latter has a list of ten books printed 
for him. By Act of the Privy Council dated November 21st, 1690, he was 
appointed Printer to the Church of Scotland and her Assemblies, in spite of 
Mrs. Anderson's opposition. He died in 1 707 or 1 708, and was succeeded by his 
widow, who printed the Acts of Assembly from 1708 to 1711. [Aldis, p. 118.] 

MOSMAN (JOHN), printer in Edinburgh, 1717-30. Printed in partnership with 
WiUiam Brown, and also as John Mosman and Company. In 1724 Mosman 
and Brown succeeded as assigns of the deceased James Watson, and there- 
after they assumed the style of King's Printers. 

MOTTE (benjamin), printer and bookseller in London, (i) Aldersgate Street ; 
(2) Middle Temple Gate, Fleet Street. 1693-1738. Began as a printer in 
Aldersgate Street, and is first mentioned in the Term Catalogues in 1693. [T.C. 
II. 469.] In 1694 he described himself as printer to the Company of Parish 
Clerks {T.C. 11. 520]. He afterwards added publishing to his business, and 
was the publisher of GuUiver's Travels, which Swift sent to him from Twicken- 
ham, where he was staying with Pope, by the hands of Charles Ford. Swift 
then asked the publisher to deUver a bank-bill of £200 to his friend Erasmus 
Lewis, on undertaking publication, but Motte preferred to get back some 



MOUNT— MOXON. 213 

of his money first, and deferred payment for six months. Motte was 
also the publisher of Miscellanies in Prose and Verse by Swift, Pope, Arbuthnot, 
and Gay, 1727. Swift maintained friendly relations with Motte, who acted 
as his London agent. Motte apparently did not give up his printing-office 
when he took to publishing, as he was included in Negus's list of printers in 
1724, as a " high-flyer ". He died on March 12th, 1738, and was succeeded by 
Charles Bathurst, who had been his partner. 

MOUNT (RICHARD), bookseller in London, Postern on Tower Hill, 1684-1722. 
BeHeved to have come of a Kentish family. His name appears in the Term 
Catalogues for the first time in Trin. 1684 as one of the publishers of a work 
on geometry. [T.C. il. 84.] Dunton mentions him as dealing chiefly in 
paper and sea books. In 1697 he was one of those from whom tickets for the 
Kentish Feast in that year could be obtained. Mount was Master of the 
Company of Stationers for the three years 17 17-19, and Nichols further 
states that he gave the Clock in the Court Room. He died June 29th, 1722, 
aged about 70. [Lit. Anecd. ill. 599.] 

MOUNTFORD, or MOUNTFORT (john), bookseller in Worcester, 1690-1710. 
In 1690 he published Admiration of Angels at the Salvation of men [T.C. 11. 331], 
and in 1706 G. Wall's Sermon upon the death of Mrs. Mary Bromley [Bodl. 
Sermons, 21 (7)] ; in The Post Boy of February 20th, 1710, his name occurs 
in a list of booksellers from whom proposals for the Corpus Poetarum Latino- 
rum could be obtained ; the abbreviated list in T.C. [in. 656-7] does not 
mention him. In 1715 he was one of the subscribers to Walker's Sufferings of 
the Clergy. 

MOXON (JAMES), bookseller in London, Strand, Charing Cross, 1668-77 > i^ 
Edinburgh, in Low Ord's Close at the foot of the Cannongate, 1689, 1647-89. 
See Dictionary, 1641-67. The last entries under his name in the Term Cata- 
logues are in Easter 1677 [T.C. I. 273, 274], when he was still in partnership 
with Joseph Moxon. George Walker's True Account of the Siege of London- 
Derry, Edinburgh, 1689, contains an engraved plan with his imprint as given 
above. [Aldis, p. 118.] 

MOXON (JOSEPH), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

MOXON (MORDECAl), bookseller in Manchester, 1679-93. I" 1683, Adam 
Martindale arranged with " Mr. Moxon, bookseller in Manchester ", for the

publication of a pamphlet. [Life, Chetham Soc, 1845, PP* 230-1.] The date 
of Moxon's decease does not appear, the latest entry referring to the family 
being the burial of his daughter, March 1693. [^- W. Procter, Memorials of 
Manchester Streets, p. 182.] 

MUNNS ( ), bookseller (?) in Cranbrook, Kent, 1699. His name appears 
in the advertisement in the Flying Post, December 2nd, 1699, of the Rev. 
Edward Brown's sermon at the Kentish Feast, It does not occur in the 
imprint of the book.

Walk, near Little Britain, 1691-4. 1674-94. Published several plays and 
romances as well as some historical works. He also dealt in cheap manuals of 
devotion and Church politics ; but his output is of a secular character to an 
extent very unusual for the time. His first and last entries in the Term 
Catalogue are in 1674 and 1694. [T.C. 1. 163, 11. 527.] 

NEEDHAM (benjamin), bookseller in London, (i) Black Raven, Duck Lane ; 
(2) Crown, Duck Lane. 1674-85. Known from the imprints to three books :

NEGUS— NEVILL. 215 

NEGUS (SAMUEL), printer in London, Silver Street near Wood Street, 1701 
(i722)-24. Chiefly remembered as the compiler in 1724 of a list of the various 
printing houses in London, classified by their political principles, as " Known 
to be well affected to King George ", " Nonjurors ", " Highflyers ", &c. 
He also gave a list of the various newspapers appearing in London, with the 
names of their publishers or printers. In the introductory epistle he states 
that he had been a printer for twenty-three years, but a master only two, 
and that he found great difficulty in making a living. He was rewarded by 
a carrier's place in the Post Office. Nichols [Lit. Awed. I. 288-312] reprints 
the whole document. 

NEILL (PATRICK), printer in Belfast, 1696 (?)-i702. Said to have come to 
Belfast in 1696, but his earliest extant imprint is dated 1699, and appears 
as Patrick Neill & Co., in that year and in 1700, and in 1701 and 1702 as 
Patrick Neill alone. All the output of his press was Puritan divinity. 

NELME, or NELMES (henry), bookseller in London, (a) Royal Exchange, 
{b) Leg & Star, Cornhill, 1696-7. Apprentice to P. Parker, who left him his 
business. Dunton [p. 229] says that Nelme came to " an untimely end ". He 
published Evangelium Medici, by Dr. Bernard Connor, 1697 [b.m. 1170. c. 
20 (i, 2)], and two other religious books, also An Impartial History of the Plots 
against . . . King William the Third. [T.C. II. 587, 589.] He also sold, in 1696, 
" Setts of Cutts for Bibles in Folio, Quarto and Octavo, curiously engraven 
on copper, containing near 200 in number . . . somewhat cheaper than usually, 
viz. the Folio at 9^. the Quarto 7^. and 6d., the Octavo and Small Quarto at 
6s. perfect." [T.C. II. 597.] 

NELSON (NORMAN), bookseller in London, Gray's Inn Gate in Holbom, 1680. 
Publisher of and dealer in law books. Also described as a " vintner " in an 
action for debt brought against him in 1680 by Robert Turner. [C.P.R., Mich. 
33, Chas. II, 2996, m. 353.] This seems to be a very late survival of a 
mixture of trades that was common enough in the sixteenth century. 

NEVILL (JOSEPH), bookseller in London, Greyhound in St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1660-72. See Dictionary, 1641-67. 

NEVILL (SARAH), bookseller in London, Archimedes in St. Paul's Churchyard,

NEWBOLT (WILLIAM), printer in London, 1684-1714. This is no doubt the 
person described in the London Gazette of September ist-4th, 1684, as 
" William Newbolt, aged 22 years, or thereabouts, a well set middle sized man 
. . . run away from his master on Monday the ist instant ; and is supposed to 
be lurking about the City of London. Whoever shall apprehend the said 
William Newbolt, and bring him to Nat. Thompson, Printer at the Entrance 
into the Old Spring Garden, near Charing Cross, shall have a Guinea reward, 
and their Charges born." In 1690 he was indicted for printing His Majesty's 
most gracious Declaration to all his loving Subjects, a Jacobite broadside found 
scattered about the streets of London. One Edward Buttler was associated 
with him and both were described as printers. The printing press was said 
to have been kept at one Douglas's at Westminster. [MS. Harl, 6846, fol. 
371-9.] He subscribed in 1714 for Walker's Sufferings oj the Clergy. 

NEWBOROUGH (m.), bookseller in London, Golden Ball, St. Paul's Church- 
yard, 1707. Probably the widow of Thomas Newborough {q. v.). Appears to 
have taken Maurice Atkins into partnership, and they, with J. Nicholson of 
the King's Arms in Little Britain, published' the third edition of Boyer's 
Wise and Ingenious Companion, French and English, a school book, which they 
advertised in Easter, 1707. \T.C. III. 548.] 

NEWBOROUGH (thomas), bookseller in London, (i) Star, St. Paul's Church- 
yard ; (2) Golden Ball, St. Paul's Churchyard. 1686-1707. One of the 
leading men in the book-trade, and concerned in many of the more important 
publications of the time. Dunton spoke of him [p. 229] as a good Churchman, 
" a thoughtful just man, and knows how to encourage a good Author, for 
none can think that the * Supplement to the Historical Dictionary ', written 
by the learned Collier, is made at a small charge." Newborough's name is 
found in the Term Catalogues for the last time in Easter, 1707. He was 
succeeded by M. Newborough, possibly his widow {q. v.), and Maurice Atkins. 
[T.C. III. 537.] 

NEWCOMB, or NEWCOME (richard), bookseller and printer in London, 
Wine-Office Court, Fleet Street, 1691-1713. In 1691 he published A Voyage 
round the World, or a Pocket Library, 3 vols., the translation or editorship of 
which is ascribed to John Dunton. [T.C ii. 338.] His name is also found in 
1 7 13 as the printer of a pamphlet entitled, What sort of a Peace is this ? 
[b.m. 1850. c. 6 (20*).] 



NEWCOMB— NEWTON. 917 

NEWCOMB (THOMAS). See Dictionary, 1641-67. He printed numbers of plays 
for Herringman. 

NEWMAN (dorman), bookseller in London, (i) King's Arms in the Poultry, 
near Grocers' Alley ; (2) Surgeons' Arms, Little Britain ; (3) Ship and 
Anchor (a) at the Bridge-Foot, {b) near the Bridge Gate, on Southwark Side. 
1665-94. See Dictionary, 1641-67. One of the largest publishers of his day ; 
but owing to speculation he went bankrupt in 1694. [London Gazette, 
September 24th-27th, 1694.] 

NEWMAN (HUGH), bookseller in London, (i) Kings Arms, Poultry ; (2) 
Grasshopper in the Poultry. 1692-1703. Served his time with Dorman 
Newman {q. v.), and was nearly related to him. [Dunton, p. 215.] His first 
entries in the Term Catalogues appear in Easter 1692, when he published The 
Life of Richard Baxter and a poem called The Jacobite Conventicle. [T.C. II. 
402-3.] He continued publishing until Trin. 1703. [T.C. III. 355.] 

NEWTON (ELIZABETH), bookseller at Portsmouth, 1708. 

NEWTON (JOHN), bookseller in London, (i) Three Pigeons in Fleet Street, 1688; 
(2) near the Sugar Loaf in Bell Alley, Coleman Street, 1689-96. 1688-96. 
Began business in 1688, by the publication of Religio Laid and an edition of 
Don Quixote. [T.C. il. 233-4.] His second address is found on a poetical broad- 
side of 1689 on the coronation of William and Mary. [b.m. C. 20. f. 2 (181).] 
He is described by Dunton [p. 233] as a man " full of kindness and good- 
nature and affable and 'courteous in trade ". His name is not found in the 
Term Catalogues after Hil. 1698. [T.C. in. 55.] 

NEWTON (w.), bookseller in London, (a) Little Britain, over against Bartholo- 
mew Close Gate, (b) near the Pump. 1 694-1 711. Newton's name first appears 
in the Term Catalogues as the publisher of a divinity pamphlet in Easter 
1694. He also sold Dutch editions of the Classics. [T.C. 11. 500 ; ill. 494.] 
In 1 71 1 his name occurs as one of the publishers of R. Bradley's Treatise of 
Succulent Plants, in an advertisement in The Post-Man of February 3rd. 
He appears to have been in partnership then with Thomas Shelmerdine. 
Their address is given as in Little Britain ; the two addresses given above 
therefore probably refer to the same house. 



2i8 NEWTON— NICHOLSON. 

NEWTON (WILLIAM), bookseller in Blandford, Dorset, 1670. Publisher in 1670 
of the Rev. John Straight's Sermon . . . at the Assizes held at Dorchester in 
1669. [Mayo, Bibl. Dorset, p. 52.] 

NICHOLSON (ANTHONY), bookbinder in Cambridge, Six Bells, 1667-80. Son 
of Anthony Nicholson [see Dictionary, 1641-67], who died in April 1667 [see 
his will in Gray & Palmer, p. 104], at which date Anthony jun. was living at 
the " Six Bells ". The inventory of his goods, dated February 2nd, 1680, 
mentions " his tooles in the shop x*. " (Gray & Palmer, p. 121). Robert 
Nicholson, the bookseller, was his brother. 

NICHOLSON (JOHN), bookseller in London, (i) King's Arms, Little Britain ; 
(2) Queen's Arms, Little Britain. 1686-1715. First heard of in the year 1686, 
when he advertised a pack of heraldic cards. [T.C. 11. 181.] Ten years later 
he was associated with T. Newborough in the publication of a Latin Testament 
for the use of scholars [T.C. 11. 603], but his place of business is not mentioned 
until 1697. From that date he was a prolific publisher of works of all kinds and 
made frequent use of the Term Catalogues. Dunton [p. 209] has this record of 
him : " His talent lies at projection, though I am thinking his Voyages and 
Travels will be a little posthumous. He is usually fortunate in what he goes 
upon. He is a man of good sense. ... He purchased part of my stock, when 
I threw up all concerns in trade ; and I ever found him a very honest man." 
Amongst Nicholson's more notable publications may be mentioned Thomas 
Gage's New Survey of the West Indies, which he shared with Newborough, and 
advertised in Easter 1699 [T.C. ill. 130], and The Index Villaris, published 
with Newborough and others in 1700. [T.C. Hi. 177.] He also shared in most 
of the large ventures of the time. He did not change his sign to the " Queen's 
Arms " in 1702, as might be supposed ; for he still called it the " King's Arms " 
in 1707, when he published, with Robert Knaplock, Hickes's edition of the 
Works of a Kempis ; there is a list of books at the end of vol. II of this. In 
1 715 William Bowyer printed for him Pearson's Exposition oj the Creed. 
[Nichols, Lit. Anecd. I. 109.] 

NICHOLSON (ROBERT), bookseller in Cambridge, 1662-89. [See Dictionary, 
1641-67.] Son of Anthony Nicholson (d. 1667) and succeeded to his father's 
business a few years before his death. Alderman Newton's Diary, ed. J. E. 
Foster, under 1687 has " ii Sept. Sunday, Sarah Nicholson, daughter of Robert 
Nicholson of Cambridge stationer, marryed at Trinity College Chapell by 



NICKS— NORMAN. 219 

Dr. Wolfran Stubb unto Robert Dawney of the Citty of Norwich worsted

inventory of the goods of John Field, 1668, Robert Gee, 1681, William Graves, 
1686, and E. Beeching, 1689. [Gray & Palmer, p. 107.] A Poem attempting 
something upon the Rarities of the renowned University of Cambridge was printed 
for him in London in 1673. [Bowes, Cambridge Books, no. no (b).] 

NICKS (JOHN), bookseller in London, White Hart in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1722. 
Published William Burscough's sermon. The Revolution recommended to our

NICOL (jAMEs), printer in Aberdeen, his printing house in the north side of the 
Castle Gate ; his shop in the end of the Broad Gate. 1710-32. In December 
1 7 10 Nicol succeeded to the widow of John Forbes, younger, whose daughter 
he had married, as printer to the town and University. On his retirement from 
business in 1736 he was succeeded by James Chalmers. [See J. P. Edmond, 
The Aberdeen Printers.] 

NISBETT (henry), bookseller in Derby, 1 704-11. In 1704 he published a 
sermon preached at St. Mary's, Nottingham, by Anthony Blackwall, and in 
1706 an edition, also by Blackwell, of Theognis. The latter was printed 
by J. Heptinstall and sold by Henry Mortlock in London. [T.C. ni. 535.] 
Blackwall was " Moderator " at Derby School. In 17 11 he printed a sermon 
preached by H. Harris at Derby on July 9th, 17 10.

NORMAN (s.), bookseller in London, 1682. New News from Tory-Land and 
Tantivy-Shire was printed for S. Norman in 1682. [b.M. 8122. aaa. 20 (12).] 

NORMAN (thomas), bookseller in London, Pope's Head in Fleet Street, (a) near 
Fleet Bridge, (b) near Sahsbury Court. 1679-80. Dealer in plays. His name 
appears in Mich. 1679, and again in Hil. 1680. [T.C. i. 370, 385.] 

NORMAN (wH-LIAM), bookseller and bookbinder, in Dublin Dame's Street, 
1682-1703. In 1682 he sold A Judgement of the Comet. In 1683 he is 
described as *' bookbinder to the Duke of Ormond ". Publisher of Sir James 



220 NORMAN— NORRIS. 

Ware's Hunting of the Romish Fox in 1684. [T.C. II. 74.] In 1686 he is 
mentioned in a list of those booksellers from whom prospectuses of a reprint 
of the works of King Charles I could be obtained. [T.C. il. 185.] He was 
printer of the Votes of the House of Commons in Ireland in 1692. [Burney, 
104 A.] In 1694 he published a sermon by St. George Ashe, printed by 
Joseph Ray. He was Master of the Booksellers' Company in Dublin, and 
was a great amateur gardener. [Dunton, pp. 238, 565-6,] 

NORRIS (jAMEs), bookseller in London, King's Arms, without Temple Bar, 
1682-4. Appears to have been related to the Rev. John Norris, Fellow of 
All Souls, Oxford, and Rector of Aldbourne in Wilts. Issued a broadside 
entitled Erra Pater'' s Prophesy, or Frost Faire, i68| ; the whole of 
this is engraved, [b.m. C. 20. f. 2 (158).] His last advertisement in the Term 
Catalogues appeared in Mich. 1694, when he issued a translation of 
Xenophon's Cyropaedia. [T.C. 11. 96.] 

NORRIS (THOMAS), bookseller and bookbinder in London, (i) St. Giles without 
Cripplegate; (2) Looking Glass on London Bridge. 1695-1732. In the course 
of an action heard in the Court of Chancery Thomas Norris, bookbinder, 
admitted having bought about five or six hundred psalters and the same 
number of primers in 1695, but declared that they were printed at Oxford. 
Some of these he sold to a Mr. Gandy, haberdasher in Milk Street. [P.R.O. 
Chan. Proc. before 1714, Collins 486/100.] Ini7ii Thomas Norris moved to the 
premises on London Bridge previously occupied by Josiah Blare. There he 
carried on the joint trades of bookbinder and bookseller, publishing many 
chapbooks and ballads as well as all kinds of nautical books. He is more than 
once mentioned in the Churchwardens' Accounts of St. Magnus. In 1720 he was 
paid three shillings for a Bible, and in 1722-3, being then one of the church- 
wardens, he made the following entries : " paid myselfe for a large Folio 
Bible for the Church, very finely bound. Delivered Dec^. 24th, 1720 
£6 lis. ^d. Paid ditto for five large common prayer, 4 for the churchwardens, 
and I for the clerk, and new binding two old Bibles £3 135. 9(i." Norris 
retired from business soon after this and settled at Highgate, where he died in 
1732, his will being proved on June 7th. He left a son William, and bequests 
to the following stationers of London, Daniel Mead of Snow Hill, Richard 
Ware and John Wilford. [P.C.C. 174, Bedford.] Gent [p. 113] says that 
Norris's daughter (or perhaps daughter-in-law) Elizabeth married, as her 



NORRIS— NUTT. 221 

second husband, in about 1720, Edward Midwinter, the printer in Pye Comer. 
Gent calls Norris " a very rich bookseller on London Bridge, whose country 
seat was at Hollo way ". 

NORRIS (w.), printer and bookseller in Taunton, 1 7 18. Set up the first press at 
Taunton ; the first piece printed and sold by him there was a sermon by 
F.Squire entitled The Lawfulness of takingOaths, 1718. [Allnutt,p.3oi ; Bodl.] 

NORTH (JOHN), bookseller in Dublin, 1682. Sold A Judgement of the Coniet, 1682. 

NORTHCOT (RICHARD), bookseller in London, next Peter's Alley in Cornhill ; 
and at the Mariner and Anchor upon Fish Street HiU, near London Bridge, 
1677-91, May have been related to Thomas Northcott or Norcott {q. v.). 
Richard was chiefly a publisher of theological works between the years named. 

NORTHCOTT, or NORCOTT (thomas), printer in London, George Yard, 
Lombard Street, 1684-90. Printer of George Fox's Journal. First men- 
tioned in the Monthly Meetings on June 25th, 1684. Dunton [p. 292] refers 
to him as " friend " Northcot. In addition to Quaker literature, he printed 
in i686 Patrick Ker's Grammatista [T.C. 11. 180], and in 1690 Mankind 
displayed. [T.C. II. 304.] 

NORTON (ROGER), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

NOTT, see also Nutt. 

NOTT (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, Queen's Arms, Old Pall Mall, 1687-90 (?) 
See Dictionary, 1641-67. A copy of The petition of the Irish Bishops to Lord 
Tyrconnell was addressed " For Mr. William Christopher ", to be left with 
Nott, in 1687. [Bodl. MS. Clar. 89, f. 105.] His last entry in the Term Cata- 
logues was in 1689. [T.C. II. 274.] For a possible reference to him in 1690 see 
Nutt (J.). 

NOWEL (n.), bookseller in London, Duck Lane, 1681-1703. In i68i he pub- 
lished Rome's Follies or, the Amorous Fryars, A Comedy. Dunton describes 
him [p. 211] thus: "Mr. Nowel is a first-rate Bookseller in Duck-Lane, 
has a well furnished shop and knows books extraordinary well, which he will 
sell off as reasonably as any man. I have always reckoned him among our 
ingenious Booksellers." He does not appear in the Term Catalogues, and 
was probably a retailer only. 

NUTT (ELIZABETH), printer in London, in the Savoy, 1 720-31. Printed T. Cox's 
Magna Britannia, 6 vols., 1720-31. She was joined by R. Nutt in 1724, having 



222 NUTT— OGSTON. 

printed vols, i and 2 alone in 1720. These two volumes were sold by M. Nutt 
{q. v.). " Nutt, in the Savoy/' is classed by Negus as a " high-flier ". 

NUTT (john), printer and bookseller in London, (i) (a) near Stationers Hall, or 
Juxta Basilicam Stationariorum, (b) in Stationers' Court ; (2) in the Savoy. 
i69o(?)-i7io(?). The Rev. Rowland Davies, Dean of Ross, records in his 
Diary under date April 3rd, 1690 : " Then I went to my brother and with him 
into the City, having at Nott's bought this book and a case for sermons for 
three shillings." [Camden Soc. Pub. no. 64, 1857, p. 97.] This entry may 
possibly refer to William Nutt, the bookseller of Pall Mall, although the latest 
reference to him in the Term Catalogues is 1688-9. On the other hand, if the 
Dean really made his purchase in the City, then the reference must be to 
John Nutt, who is not otherwise known to have been established there until 
1698. [T.C. III. 95.] Dunton again has added to the confusion. He says of 
" Mr. Nutt" : " He was originally a printer, and lived with Mr. Jones in the 
Savoy for many years . . . and now gives as great content to those that employ 
him as any publisher whatever." This was written in 1703, but John Nutt, 
the printer in the Savoy, is not mentioned in the Term Catalogues as a printer 
until 1708. The fact seems to be that Nutt gave up bookselling about 1708 to 
resume his earlier trade as a printer. His last entry in the Term Catalogues is 
Moll's Atlas, 1709, printed by him. [T.C. ill. 651.] He was apparently 
succeeded by Elizabeth Nutt (q. v.), probably his widow. His most famous 
publication was Swift's Tale of a Ttcb, 1704 and reprints to 1710. 

NUTT (m.), bookseller in London, in Exeter Exchange in the Strand, 1720. 
See Nutt (Elizabeth). 

NUTT (R.) See Nutt (Elizabeth). 

NUTT (WILLIAM), see also Nott. 

OAKES (edward), printer and bookseller in London, Well- Yard, near West 
Smithfield, 1663-72 (?). See Dictionary, 1641-67. In 1670 he printed (as E. O.), 
for Francis Haley, The Opinion of Witchcraft Vindicated, by R. T., and in 
1 67 1 he published with Haley Dean Lloyd's Legend of Captain Jones. 
[b.m. 1077. b. 38.] In the 1675 list of Printing Houses, it is stated that this 
house had been " bought in " by the Company of Stationers, " since 1672." 

OGILBY (JOHN), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

OGSTON (ALEXANDER), bookseller in Edinburgh, in the Parliament Close, 
1685-8. In 1688 he was threatened for selling anti-popish books, and in the 



OGSTON— OLIVER. 323 

same year Mrs. Anderson seized some octavo Bibles he had imported from 
London. Amongst his publications were G. Scot's Model . . . Government . . . 
East-New-Jersey, 1685, S. Colvill's Mock-poem, or whigs supplication, 1687, 
and Bibliotheca Universalis, 1688. He was succeeded by his widow Martha 
Ogston iq.v.). [Aldis, p. 118.] 

OGSTON (jAMES), bookseller in Edinburgh, ^.1714. Will registered August 31st, 
1714. 

OGSTON, afterwards STEVENSON (martha), bookseller in Edinburgh, in the 
Parliament Close. 1688-1738 (?). Widow of Alexander Ogston, whom she 
succeeded. Her will, under the name of " Martha Stevenson, relict of 
Alexander Ogston, bookseller in Edinburgh '*, was registered on January 20th, 
1738. [Aldis, p. 18.] 

OKES, see Oakes. 

OLIVER ( ), Mrs., bookseller in Norwich, 171 1-25. Perhaps the widow of 
Francis Oliver, who ceased publishing in 17 12 ; if so, her publishing in the 
last year of his activity might be accounted for by his illness. [iV. 6* Q., loth 
Ser., V. 184.] It seems very improbable that this Mrs. Oliver is identical with 
Mrs. Elizabeth Oliver {q. v.). No address is given in N. 6* Q. 

OLIVER (elkabeth), bookseller in Norwich, Cockey Lane, 1689-1704. 
William Oliver (q. v.) was succeeded in 1689 by his widow, at whose house 
and for whose benefit Edward Millington of London held an auction, probably 
of Oliver's stock, on December 16th. [London Gazette, November 28tli- 
December 2nd, 1689 ; B.M. 821. i. 2 (4).] Three sermons, by J. Brett, J. Jefiery, 
and J. Robinson, all of 1704, bear her imprint [Quinton, Bibl. Norf., pp. 54, 
235 ; Bodl. Sermons, 17], after which she disappears. Francis Oliver, pre- 
sumably her son, began business at the same address in 1704. 

OLIVER (FRANCIS), bookseller in Norwich, Cockey Lane, 1704-12. Probably 
a son of William Oliver, whose widow he succeeded in 1704, between which 
year and 17 12 he is known to have published five books, at least four of them 
being sermons ; most of them were printed for him by Freeman Collins. 
[T.C. m. 391 ; Quinton, Bibl. Nor/., pp. 94, 528-9, 65, 71, 2.] His relation- 
ship to the Mrs. Oliver {q.v.) who was in business in Norwich from 1711 is 
obscure. 

OLIVER (SAMUEL), bookseller in Norwich, 1692-3. Probably a son of William 
Oliver. His publications are confined to two years, and consist of Peter 



224 OLIVER— ORME. 

Choavin's De Naturali Religione, 1693, and four sermons, one of which was 
printed for him by John Russell, printer to the University of Cambridge. 
[Quinton, Bibl Nor/., pp. 444, 548 ; T.C. 11. 408, 451, 4S5-] 

OLIVER (WILLIAM), bookseller inNorwich, i663-89(?). See Dictionary, 1641-67. 
Publishing at least as late as i68o, when he had Three Sermons by C. Robotham 
printed for him in London [Quinton, Bibl. Nor/., p. 440], and perhaps as late 
as 1689, at the end of which year the widow Oliver had an auction, probably of 
her husband's stock. His son John was admitted to St. John's College, 
Cambridge, on July 8th, 1681. [Admissions to St. John's College , 11. 84.] 

ONELY, see Onley. 

ONLEY (WILLIAM), printer in London, (i) Little Britain ; (2) Bond's Stables, 
near Chancery Lane. 1 697-1 709. A printer of ballads, broadsides, and chap- 
books for various London publishers. But one of his first productions was a 
more literary work, the second edition of D'Urfey 's Cinthia and Endimion, which 
he printed in 1697 for S. Briscoe and R. Wellington. Dunton's character-sketch 
of him [p. 248] lays stress on the rapidity of his work and his popularity with 
the journeymen printers, and tells us that " being very ingenious, by his own 
projections he keeps two printing houses constantly at work ; one in Little 
Britain, and the other in Bond's stables, near Chancery Lane". John How, 
1709, asks : " How many copies of other mens has Mr. Onely printed, and 
whether the booksellers of London, particularly those on the Bridge, were not 
his customers for the said books } What Mr. Keble recovered of Mr. Onely 
when he sued him for printing ' The Week's Preparation ' ? " [Some Thoughts 
on the Present State of Printing and Bookselling, p. 10.] Onley frequently 
used his initials only, and very rarely dated his books. 

ORME (jAMEs), printer in London, 1692-8. This printer was employed by 
several London pubHshers, including R. Basset, R. Bentley, A. Bosvile, 
Thomas Jones, Randal Taylor, and R. Wellington. He printed in 1692 
Elkanah Settle's Triumphs oj London, in 1697 Edward Filmer's tragedy, 
The Unnatural Brother, in the same year Mary Pix's comedy, The Innocent 
Mistress, and in 1698 Crowne's tragedy, Caligula. 

ORME (JOHN), bookbinder in London, 1681-2. In Mich. 2,3 Chas. II he brought 
an action in the Court of Common Pleas against William Hare for false im- 
prisonment. [C.P.R. 2997, m. 448 r.] i 



ORREL— OVERTON. 225 

GRREL (THOMAS), bookseller in London, Hand and Scepter, Fleet Street, 1678. 
In 1678 he published (i) a play, The Rambling Justice, (2) a miscellany of 
verse, Oxford Drollery, and (3) Words made Visible. [T.C. i. 320, 330, 332.] 

OSBORN, or OSBORNE (john), bookseller in London, (i) Oxford Arms in 
Lombard Street; (2) Paternoster Row. 1711-39. First met with in partnership 
with T. Vamam, who succeeded to the business of Thomas Guy [T.C. in. 667], 
and in 1725 he is found publishing with his son-in-law, T. Longman, at the 
Ship in Paternoster Row. Nichols says that he became Master of the Company 
of Stationers in 1735 and died on March 13th, 1739. [Lit. Anecd., in. 601.] 

OSBORN, or OSBORNE (Robert), bookseller in Exeter, near the Bear, 1693-6. 
He was local agent for the sale of two sermons : (i) The Pastor's Care and 
Dignity, and the peoples Duty. A sermon preached . . .at Taunton, by G[eorge] 
T[rosse], 1693. [GiUing, Life of Trosse, p. 127 ; Dredge, 10.] (2) llot/xny 
*uXaKiov, The Pastor's Charge and the Peoples Duty, A Sermon, by Samuel 
Stoddon, 1694. [Dredge, 10.] In 1696 he issued A Sermon preached in . . . 
Exeter on the Thanksgiving Day. [Dredge, 94.] This had a leaf with a 
list of books printed for him. 

OSBORNE (THOMAS), bookseller in London, Gray's Inn, near the Walks, 1702-43, 
In Trin. 1702 he sold an edition of Glanvil's translation of Fontenelle's 
Plurality of Worlds. [T.C. ni. 313.] Osborne died in 1743, and was succeeded 
by his son Thomas. It was the latter who bought the Harleian Library and 
employed Oldys and Johnson to catalogue it ; his relations with the latter

to the White Horse without Newgate, the shop previously occupied by Henry 
Overton {g. v., Dictionary, 1641-67), who was perhaps his father. John Overton 
established a good business in prints, maps, and engravings of all kinds, and 
was the principal vendor of mezzotints of his day. In 1707, on the occasion 
of his son Henry's marriage, he sold him his stock-in-trade and retired in 
his favour. He died in 17 13, his will being proved on April 2nd. Besides 
Henry (q. v.) he left three other sons : Thomas, who went to America, James, 
and Philip (q. v.). 

OVERTON (PHILIP), bookseller and printseller in London, White Horse without 
Newgate, 1709. Stated in Arber's index [T.C. iii. 728] to have sold G. de 
L'Isle's map (Theatrum Historicum) ; the entry of it on the page referred to 
[ill. 647] does not contain his or his brother's name, but the map does. 

OWEN (JOHN), bookseller in Oxford and Cambridge, 1701-10. On October 4th, 
1 701, the University of Cambridge entered into an agreement with John Owen 
of Oxford, stationer, for the production of an edition of Suidas's Lexicon in 
three volumes folio ; Owen to pay £i 10s. 6d. per sheet, paying for the first 
100 copies when the second 100 were ready for delivery, and so on, six months 
credit being given for the last 200, the whole stock to remain at the Press as 
security till paid for. Owen being unable to fulful his part of the engagement, 
on April i6th, 1703, a Grace was passed for a new contract with Sir T. Jannson 
in place of John Owen, insolvent. Owen's failure placed the University in 
difficulties with regard to the work, and correspondence and negotiations 
respecting it went on for a period of forty years. The work was published by 
the University Press in 1705, when the degree of LL.D. was given to the 
editor. Correspondence concerning the work will be found in the Cor- 
respondence of Dr. Richard Bentley. Other works were arranged for by Owen 
between 1 701-10, and some bear his name as " typographus ", which may 
only mean " publisher ". In one of these, Simon Ockley's Introductio ad 
Linguas Orientates, 1706, is a long dedication to Elias Abenaker of London, 
Gent.,in which he speaks of his having been induced, by " specious promises",

Encourager of Arts and Sciences, and Printing in particular ") to leave 
Oxford for Cambridge, and acknowledges the "noble assistances you have 
supplied me with, to raise my Fortune in the World, and put my Affairs into 
a prosperous and flourishing Condition." In 1703 he published volume i of 
C. Cellarius' Notitia Orbis Antiqui, sive Geographia Plenior, but volume 11 bears 
the imprint " Amstelaedami Casparus Fritsch ", and was issued in 1706. He 
was in Holland in 1706, and was entrusted with books and letters from 
Rheland and L. Kuster to Dr. Bentley and others. The last book to bear his 
imprint is a Sallust of 1 7 10. [R, Bowes's Cambridge Printers, p. 31 2, Cambridge

probably George Parker, who is only known to have been in business in 1683. 

PAGE (dixy). See Dictionary, 1641-67. He was still publishing in 1672, when

PALMER (SAMUEL), printer in London, Bartholomew Qose, 1723 (?)-32. 
The exact date at which Palmer set up is unknown. He was probably at 
work in 1700, but we first hear of him as printing Sternhold and Hopkins 
for the Stationers' Company in 1723. Franklin, when he came to England 
at the end of 1724, was employed in Palmer's printing house, which he calls 
famous. [Autobiography, ed. J. Bigelow, 1909, p. 91.] He is chiefly remem- 
bered as part author of a very bad History oj Printing. Originally his intention 
was to write a book about the practical p)art of the art ; but he was deterred 
by the fears of the trade that he would betray secrets, and turned his work 
into a history of printing, which was issued in parts but was not completed at 
the author's death. Although his business was a large one. Palmer eventually 
became bankrupt, and died on May 9th, 1732. His History was continued by 
George Psalmanazar. The work as a whole was published in 1732. This 
History was worthless, and has been treated with contempt. J. Lewis, writing 
to Ames, described Palmer as " a good printer, but a bad historian, ignorant, 
careless and inaccurate ". [Nichols, lllustr. of Lit. rv. 174.] His merits as a 
printer caused him to be selected to supervise a private press set up by some

of the Royal Family at St. James's in 173 1. The following notice of his death 
appeared in The Norwich Gazette, May 6th-i3th, 1732 : " Last Thursday died

Journal, and author of the History of Printing. He has not left his equal, 
either as a printer or as a scholar." He printed the Grtib Street Journal in 1731

PARDOE (mark), bookseller in London, Black Raven, Strand, over against 
Bedford House, 1677-86. Hazlitt records a book as published by him in 1677. 
The earliest reference to him in the Terra Catalogues is in 1680. \T.C. i. 385.]

this. Thomas Parkhurst was bound apprentice to John Garke, bookseller in 
London, in 1645, and was made a Freeman of the Company of Stationers on 
July 3rd, 1654. He began to publish theological books about that date, and 
a list of twenty-five publications on sale by him in 1657 is found at the end of 
S. Purchas's Theatre oj Political Flying Insects, [bjm. 452. a. 37.] Another 
and longer list, arranged under sizes, was issued with W. Seeker's Nonsuch 
Professor, 1660. About 1667 opened the Golden Bible upon London 
Bridge, in addition to his other shop in Cheapside near Mercers' Chapel, 
both imprints being given on T. Wadsworth's Immortality of the Soul 
explained {T.C. I. 64], but he apparently gave up the London Bridge shop 
before the end of the year 167 1. In 1679 he published for Capt. W. Bedloe 
The Excommunicated Prince . . . being the Popish Plot in a play, the imprint to 
which was " The Bible and Three Crowns in the Poultry ". Probably all his 
imprints, except the Little Britain and London Bridge ones, refer to one house. 
Dunton was one of Thomas Parkhurst's apprentices, and spoke well of him as 
a master. He calls him the most " eminent Presbyterian bookseller in the 
Three Kingdoms ", and adds, " He has printed more practical books than any 
other that can be named in London." [Dunton, pp. 39, 42, 205, 224, 699.] 
In 1689 Parkhurst served the office of Under Warden, and in 1703 was chosen 
Master of the Company of Stationers. He gave up business in 17 11, his stock 
being sold by auction by Thomas Ballard at the Black Boy Coffee House, in 
Ave-Mary Lane on Febniary 5th and following evenings.

medical works ; while three books, two of which are medical and the third a 
novel, are advertised on the last leaf of An Historical Account of the Late 
Troubles, during the wars of Paris, pubUshed by Henry Chapman in 1686, as 
for sale by " Jo. Partridge " at the above address. But " Jo." may be a 
misprint. James Partridge's name appears in the Term Catalogues for the last 
time in 1694. \T.C. ii. 525.] James Partridge, Matthew Gilliflower and Samuel 
Heyrick termed themselves Printers to the House of Lords in i68| ; but as 
none of them were printers by trade, they must have farmed out the office.

PEMBERTON— PEPYAT. 235 

informs him that " Peisley the bookseller has bought the whole impression of

PINDAR (JOHN), bookseller in Cambridge, 1663 (?)-i703 (?). Published 
The Tablet of Cebes, Done out of Greek into English by Robert Warren, 1699. 
[Haz. 11. 88.] He may be the John Pindar who witnessed the last will and testa- 
ment of Jonathan Pindar, 1663 [Gray and Palmer, p. 100], and is mentioned 
in the will of William Morden, 1678, as living in the parish of St. Michael's in 
a tenement adjoining that of Morden's. [lb. 118.] A John Pindar in 1689 
gave ;^i5 towards buying a bell for St. Michael's Church. [Cooper, Memorials 
of Cambridge, III. 342.] As no record of his death appears in the Church 
Registers it may be that he moved to Great St. Mary's parish to a house by the 
side of the Market Place, where we know a John Pindar was living from 1699 
to his death in 1703, when his widow continued to live there until 17 14. 



238 PINDAR— PITT. 

PINDAR (JONATHAN), the First, printer and bookbinder (?) in Cambridge, 
i68o(?)-98. Appointed University Printer June nth, 1686, but in March 
1693 another Printer was appointed, and on October loth, 1698, a Grace was 
passed for an annuity of £5 each to Hugh Martin and Pindar, " formerly 
elected printers ", [Bowes, Cambridge Printers, p. 310.] No books printed at the 
University Press bear his imprint. Probably a relative of Jonathan Pindar, 
d. 1663 [Gray and Palmer, p. roo], and of John Pindar {q, v.). A Jonathan 
Pindar appraised the goods of Anthony Nicholson {q. v.) 1680, Rose Browne 
1687, Robert Gee {q. v.) 1681, William Graves {q. v.) 1686, and E. Beeching 
{q. V.) 1689. [Gray and Palmer.] John Pindar, Gent., in his will, dated June 25th, 
proved September 30th, 1680, left property and money to Jonathan Pindar 
and his wife, and £10 to apprentice their son Jonathan {q. v.) and £10 to be 
paid to him when twenty-one years of age ; also to another son John property 
and reversion of property. In the University Audit Books for 1692-4 are 
entries for payments made to a bookbinder of this name, who may be the same 
person. [Bowes, Cambridge Printers, p. 311.] 

PINDAR (JONATHAN), the Second, printer at Cambridge, 1699-1730. Appointed 
University Printer September 8th, 1699. " On 28 August 1730, there is a Grace 
declaring the voidance of the office of Printer to be necessary before certain pro- 
posals for printing Bibles and Prayer-Books can be settled, and offering 
Pindar the continuance of his full salary after his resignation." [Bowes, 
Cambridge Printers, p. 311.] This must be the son of Jonathan Pindar the 
First, mentioned in John Pindar's will. 

PITT (MOSES), bookseller and printer, London and Oxford ; London, (i) White 
Hart, Little Britain, 1668-73 ; (2) (a) Angel, in St. Paul's Churchyard, 
(b) over against the Little North Door of St. Paul's Church, 1673-86; 
(3) Duke Street, Westminster, 1688 ; Oxford, The Theatre, 1680-82. 1668-96. 
Son of John Pitt, yeoman, of St. Teath, Cornwall. On October ist, 1654, 
Moses Pitt was bound apprentice to Robert Littlebury, citizen and haber- 
dasher of London, and was made free of the Haberdashers' Company on 
November 8th, 1661 . His first publication was Thomas Brancker's Introduction 
to Algebra, 1668. He continued to publish copiously. Shortly before 1679, 
when Dr. Fell was looking for some London men to manage the printing and 
bookselling business on which the University of Oxford was embarking at his 
suggestion, he chose Moses Pitt as one of them, and it is interesting to read 
Pitt's own narrative of the transaction as set out in his pamphlet, The Cry of 



PLACE— PLAYFORD. 239 

the Oppressed. He there says : " Having undertaken the printing of an Atlas 
or Description of the Whole World, which will be about Twelve volums in 
Folio . . . and being much incouraged by Dr. Fell, then Bishop of Oxford, I 
took of him the Printing House at Oxford called The Theatre, where I have 
finished four of the volums . , . and have Two volums more almost finished . . . 
and did also purchase of the Bishop a great quantity of Books, to the value of 
many thousands of pounds. And did in the latter end of King Charles Time, 
print great quantities of Bibles, Testaments, Common Prayers &c. in all 
volums, whereby I brought down the price of Bibles &c. more than half, which 
did great good at that time (Popery then being likely to over-flow us)." He 
continued to publish in London throughout these years, and till 1688. The 
published volumes of the Atlas appeared in 1680-82. Had he confined himself 
to bookselling Pitt might have completed the publication of The English 
Atlas, and retired a rich man ; but he launched out into building speculations, 
chiefly in Westminster, over which he lost large sums of money and weakened 
his credit to such an extent that his partners in the bookselling business 
and Bible trade [see Guy (Thomas)] cut themselves loose from him. In 

. Pitt's own words, " they pretended that I ow'd them some hundreds of pounds, 
and they lock't up my Oxford-warehouse ". But it was a relative, Adiel Mill 
{q. v.), who, taking advantage of Pitt's difficulties, advanced him money 
on exorbitant terms for his building schemes and induced the unfortunate 
bookseller to hand over to him his " stock of books, atlases. Atlas paper. Copper 
Plates, Pictures, Printing Press, letters &c.", afterwards forcing him to become 
a prisoner in the Fleet Prison for debt. Whilst there Pitt wrote a graphic 
account of the miseries suffered by the prisoners, which he entitled The Cry of 
the Oppressed, 1691. At the same time he endeavoured to raise money for 
them in various ways. Pitt remained a prisoner from April 20th, 1689, to 
May i6th, 1691. He married a Miss Upman, perhaps a relative of the Rev. — 
Upman, to whom he refers in his Cry. After his release Pitt wrote An Account 
of one Ann Jeff cries . . who was Jed for six months by . . .fairies, 1696.

John Playford the Younger (?). 

PLAYFORD (JOHN), the Elder, see Dictionary, 1641-67, 



240 PLAYFORD— PONDER. 

PLAYFORD (JOHN), the Younger, printer in London, Little Britain, 1679-85. 
Son of Matthew Playford, rector of Great Stanmore^ and nephew of John 
Playford the elder. [See Dictionary, 1641-67.] From 1679 to 1683 he was in 
partnership with Ann, widow of William Godbid, the music printer, [See 
Dictionary, 1641-67.] In 1684 and 1685 Playford carried on the business 
alone ; he died in 1685. He printed the sixth and seventh editions of The 
Dancing Master, 1679 and 1686, the latter issued posthumously. [D. N. B.] 

PONDER (NATHANIEL), bookseller in London, (i) Peacock in Chancery Lane ; 
(2) Peacock, Poultry, (a) near Cornhill, (b) over against the Stocks Market. 
1669-1700 (?), Publisher of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. He was the son of 
John Ponder, a Nonconformist mercer, of Rothwell, in Northamptonshire. 
On June 2nd, 1656 Nathaniel Ponder was bound apprentice to Robert Gibbs, 
bookseller, of Chancery Lane, and, at the expiration of his term, set up as a 
bookseller at the sign of the Peacock in Chancery Lane. His first entry, in 
the Term Catalogue for Easter 1669, was Dr. Owen's Brief Declaration and 
Vindication of the doctrine of the Trinity [T.C. i. 8], and he became the publisher 
of most of the writings of that Nonconformist leader. Another of his patrons 
was Sir Charles Wolseley, a Cromwellian, In 1676 Ponder opened a second 
shop in the Poultry ; but shortly afterwards gave up the premises in Chancery 
Lane, and on August loth in that year he was committed to prison for publish- 
ing Andrew Marvell's Rehearsal Transposed. [S.P.D.Chas.II,vol. 174, f. 161.] 
The first edition of Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress was advertised by Ponder 
in the Term Catalogue for Hil. 1677-8, as an octavo, to be sold for the sum of 
eighteenpence. Probably no one was more surprised than the publisher at 
the success achieved by this publication. Three editions were called for 
within twelve months. Ponder found it difficult to keep pace with the ever- 
increasing demand for the book, and was obliged to get it printed where and 
how he could, so that misprints crept in and were not rectified, while the 
whole production steadily deteriorated with every fresh edition, and sur- 
reptitious and unauthorized editions were put on the market by unscrupulous 
publishers. Ponder did not publish only Nonconformist divinity ; in 1685 he 
published the English translation of Le Vayer de Boutigny's Tarsis et Zilie, 
a romance in folio. About 1680 Ponder consigned to a certain Mercy Brown- 
ing, a bookseller at Amsterdam, a large parcel of books, for sale on commission^ 
It seems highly probable that she was a connexion of Thomas Browning of 
Rothwell, a Nonconformist minister for whom Nathaniel Ponder made apph- 



PONDER. 241 

cation for a licence to preach in 1672. This transaction between Mercy 
Browning and Ponder became the subject of a lawsuit in 1692, Mercy 
Browning, as Ponder alleged, having sold her stock to a certain Rest Fenner 
{q. V.) without having paid for the books consigned to her by Ponder, A 
curious point about this lawsuit is that Ponder stated that the consignment 
was made in 1678, and included two copies of Whitelock's Memorials of 
Affairs of State, which was not published until 1682. [Chancery Proc. before 
1714, Reynardson, Bundle 428, 132,] In 16S1 Ponder was one of a number 
of London printers and booksellers against whom a mysterious action for 
assault was brought by Bartholomew Sprint. [C.P.R. 2992, m. 256 r.] The 
fourth edition of the Pilgrirri's Progress had appeared in the previous year, 
and a part of the impression bore, on the back of the portrait, an " Advertise- 
ment ", in which in bitter terms Ponder accused Thomas Braddyl of printing 
unauthorized editions of the work ; yet in 1688 he was employing this same 
printer to print an edition of ten thousand copies, as well as an edition of five 
thousand copies of the second part, and five thousand copies of Bunyan's 
Grace Abounding. All this we learn from a lawsuit begun by Ponder against 
Braddyl in the Court of Chancery in 1697. From this we further learn that 
Ponder was a prisoner in the King's Bench Prison for debt in 1688, and that 
Braddyl, in addition to settling an execution with which Ponder was threatened, 
had also supplied Ponder's son with clothes to the value of £14. After this 
little more is heard of Ponder. Mr. Arber states {T.C. ill. 730], that he 
published the 3rd edition of Bunyan's Mr. Badman in 1700 from " London 
Yard, at the West End of St. Paul's Church ", but the edition in question is 
dated 1696, not 1700 ; the edition of 1700 was issued by the Churchills. 
Ponder sold an edition of Bunyan's Holy War in 1696 [Bodl. Arch. Bodl. A. 
I. 48] ; the last editions of Pilgrim's Progress issued by him were Pt. I. edd. 11 
and 12, 1688 and n. d. Pt. Ii. ed. 3 was issued in 1690, and Pt. i. ed. 13 in 1693, 
by R. Ponder, i. e. presumably his son Robert. One W. P., who may be a rela- 
tion, figures in Bunyan imprints from 1695 to 1702. He left, besides Robert, 
who married Mary, the daughter of Robert Guy of Isham, Northants, 
three daughters, Mary, Susannah, and Hannah. [Chan. Proc. before 17 14, 
Collins *3®^ ^ri]- An interesting article on Nathaniel Ponder, written by 
Mr. W. Perkins, appeared in The Wellingborough News, October 2nd, i903!«

" he pursues his business very closely and is a person of great integrity." 
He died in this year and his widow or daughter, Hannah Richards {q. v.), 
succeeded him. [Creswell, pp. 5-7.] 

RICHARDSON (edmond), bookbinder and bookseller in London ; (i) Scalding 
Alley ; (2) Naked Boy, Blowbladder Street, over against St. Martin-le-Grand, 
1698 ; (3) Naked Boy, Newgate Street, 1699-1703 ; (4 ?) near the Poultry

Leather Books whilst I lived in the Poultry. . . . Having thrived by his binding 
trade, he is now a flourishing bookseller in Newgate Street". In 1691 he

houses of 1675 as one of those who had set up since the Act was in force. 
He printed the 1685 edition of Cocker's Arithmetick for Passinger and Lacy. 
He also printed for Dunton, who speaks of him [p. 250] as being then (in 1703)

altogether dead in him ; for I am informed his son anji he have married two 
sisters ". He was Under-Warden of the Company in 1696-7.

Puerilis in 1670. [T.C. I. 62.] 

RIVINGTON (CHARLES), bookseller in London, (i) Bible and Crown, St. Paul's 
Churchyard, 17 11-42. Bom in 1688, the second son of Thurston Rivington, 
of Chesterfield, he was apprenticed to Matthews, bookseller {q. v.), and took 
up his freedom in 1711. He must have already had considerable capital, 
though his father did not die till 1734, as he in the same year bought the 
business of Richard Chiswell, the large bookseller and publisher in St. Paul's 
Churchyard, who was just dead. He announced Pierre Jurieu's Practice 
of Devotion in Easter 17 11 [T.C. III. 659] from the Bible and Crown in 
St. Paul's Churchyard (Chis well's sign had been the Rose and Crown), The 
D.N.B. states that his first house was in Paternoster Row, and Mr. S. 
Rivington says that he moved in 17 14 to the Bible and Crown at no. 62 on the 
north side of St. Paul's Churchyard ; but he would naturally have succeeded 
to Chiswell's house in the Churchyard in 17 11, instead of going to another in 
Paternoster Row. He kept up the religious character of Chiswell's business, 
and later published for the Wesleys and Whitefield. He also did a large 
business in publishing sermons on commission. He is the hero of the story of 
the country vicar who ordered 35,000 copies of a sermon to be printed. 
Rivington agreed after a protest, and, having sold 17, sent him a bill for 
some £784, but reassured him a day or two later by confessing that he had 
only printed 100. A list of some of Rivington's early publications is given in 
Fenelon's Pastoral Letter, 17 15. He was one of the founders in 1736 of the new 
" Conger " or booksellers' club for buying and selling shares in copies. He and 
Osborne share the credit not only of publishing Pamela, but of having 
suggested to Richardson the idea of a collection of letters, which developed 
into it. He died on February 22nd, 1742, and was succeeded by two sons, 
John and James, out of a large family ; Richardson acted as guardian to his 
children and trustee for the business till John's majority. [S. Rivington, The 
Publishing Family of Rivington, 1919 ; D.N.B.] 



ROBERTS— ROBINSON. 955 

ROBERTS (j.), bookseller in Bridgwater, 1698-1700. In 1698 he published, 
with S. and J. Sprint, A Sermon preached at Bridgwater, by J. B,, and in 
1699-1700, with J. Sprint, Religion justified in a sermon preached before . . .the 
Mayor . . . of Bridgwater , by J. H., Minister. [T.C. ill. 90, 167.] 

ROBERTS (jAMES), printer and bookseller in London, (i) near Stationers' Hall, 
1706; (2) Warwick Lane, 1713-54. 1706-54. In 1706 J. Gilbert's 
Reflections on Dr. Fleetwood's Essay upon Miracles was printed for J. Roberts 
near Stationers' Hall. [T.C. III. 508, 521.] It is not clear whether he was 
identical with the printer James Roberts, of Warwick Lane, who was able to 
subscribe five guineas to the Bowyer Fund in 17 13, was classed by Negus as 
" well-afTected ", was Master of the Stationers' Company in 1729, 1730, and 
1731, and died, aged 85, on November 2nd, 1754, and whom Nichols, in 
giving these facts [Lit. Anecd,, III. 737] calls " a printer of great eminence ". 
He also published books. 

ROBERTS (r.), printer in London, 1679 (?)-99. He may be the R. R. who with 
A. M. printed in 1679 A True Relation of the . . . Cruelties lately acted by the 
Rebels in Scotland. [Haz. III. 224.] He is first mentioned in the Term Catalogues 
in Mich. 1685, as printer of The Mirror of Martyrs. The advertisement states 
that it was printed " for R. Roberts " ; but in this as in many other cases, it 
does not imply that he was a regular bookseller. In 1690 one R. R,, with 
M. C, printed for Adiel Mill a folio ed. of the Letters of Gerard Vossius. In 
1692 Roberts printed the Votes of the House of Commons in Ireland. [Bumey, 
104 a], and in 1699, for J. Nutt, Dr. W. Harris's Description of the King's 
Palace and Gardens at Loo. [T.C. III. 154.] Dunton says of " Mr. Roberts " 
(no doubt this man) : *' In twenty books that he printed for me he never dis- 
appointed me once ... so that what he left to his Widow will wear well " ; 
which shows that he was dead before 1703. 

ROBERTSON (JOHN), printer in Edinburgh, 1725-48. Dr. John Lee, in his 
Memorial for the Bible Societies, records several editions of the Psalms in Metre 
and Confession of Faith printed at Edinburgh by T. Lumisden and John

1707. 1688-1726. Nephew of Abel Roper I, who in a will by which he left him 
all his copies, expressed a hope that the young man might serve his apprentice- 
ship under him. This wish was not fulfilled, as Abel Roper I died within a year 
of making his will, on March 4th, i6^§. Abel Roper II is first met with in the 
Term Catalogue of Trin. 1688. {T.C. n. 229.] In 169 1 he was sued by Thomas

he employed A. Boyer to translate news for the paper. In August 1709 
Boyer was discharged and at once set up a rival sheet called The True Post

in 171 1. [jT.C. in. 669.] 

SARE (RICHARD), bookseller in London, Gray's Inn Gate, Holborn, 1684-1723. 
The son of a clergyman ; he was apparently in partnership with S. Heyrick, 
of this address, but each published independently. Sare's first publication was, 
with D. Brown, the eleventh edition of Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum, in 1684. 
[T.C.ll. 105.] He prospered, and published many books. In 1693 ^^ published 
L'Estrange's translation of Josephus ; while it was in the press T. Basset and 
the other owners of the copyright of the older translation printed an adver- 
tisement in protest, and Sare another in reply, [b.m. 806. k. 15 (20*, 20**).] 



262 . SARE— SAVILE, 

He supported the Government, and was generally careful in what he 
published as well as personally blameless ; but the casual sale of a copy of 
The Rights of the Christian Church Asserted exposed him to a frivolous prose- 
cution by Samuel Hilliard, Prebendary of Lincoln, which resulted in his 
acquittal. [S. Hilliard, A Narrative of the Prosecution of Mr. Sare, 1709, 
B.M, 702. f. 2 (3) ; A Defence of the Rights of the Christian Church, 1709, 
B.M. 858. d. 9.] According to Nichols, Sare was one of the oldest and steadiest 
friends of the elder Bowyer, and after the fire at his printing-house in 17 13 
collected over £66 for his benefit. \Lit. Anecd. i. 61, 63.] Sare died on 
February 2nd, 1 7 2|. His funeral sermon, from which much of what we know of 
him is derived, was preached by Dean Stanhope ; it was printed by Bowyer 
for Richard Williamson, who succeeded to Sare's business. Both the Dean 
and Dun ton [p. 218] warmly praise Sare's amiability and high character. 

SARE (thomas), bookseller in London, right over against the Black Prince in 
Duck Lane, 1673. His imprint occurs in the Rev. Richard Steele's Antidote 
against Distractions , 3rd ed., 1673. \T.C. I. 137.] 

SAUNDERS, see also Sanders. 

SAUNDERS, or SANDERS (e.), bookseller in London, Crown in the Pall Mall, 
1683-92. Associated with S. Holt in publishing an Engb'sh translation of 
J. Commelin's Belgick or Netherlandish Hesperides, 1683. \T.C. il. 19.] 
In 1692 he was the publisher of A Collection for the Improvement of Husbandry 
and Trade, [b.m. Bumey, 105 A.] 

SAUNDERS (FRANCIS), bookseller in London, Blue Anchor on the New Exchange 
in the Strand, 1684-99. Partner with Joseph Knight. They succeeded to 
the business of Henry Herringman in 1684, and were therefore the leading 
pubhshers of plays. The partnership was dissolved about 1688, when Knight 
moved to the Pope's Head in the New Exchange. Saunders is last met with 
in the Term Catalogues in Trin. 1699. \T.C. III. 149.] Dunton says [p. 214], 
" He lived in the New Exchange and had the honour to be personally known 
to very many of the Nobility and Gentry of the first rank in England," and 
adds that he " lived long a bachelor, being too busy to think of Love ". 

SAVILE (GEORGE), bookseller in London, 1674. Published Defensio Legis, 
by Fabian Philips, 1674 [Haz. II. 473], which, however, was advertised by 
WiUiam Cooper. [T.C. I. 155.] 



SAWBRIDGE. 263 

SAWBRIDGE (george), the Elder, see Dictionary , 1641-67. George Sawbridge, 
the Younger {q. o.)> was probably not son of this man but of Thomas Saw- 
bridge, whom he succeeded. 

SAWBRIDGE (george), the Younger, bookseller in London, Three Golden 
Fleur de Luces, Little Britain, 1692-17 11. Succeeded Thomas Sawbridge 
{q. v., Dictionary, 1641-67) at this address in 1692. He published many 
scientific books. In 1705 he was convicted of printing or publishing a pam- 
phlet entitled The Case of the Church of England's Memorial, and sentenced 
to pay £200 to the Queen and to appear in all the Courts in Westminster with 
a paper upon his head denoting his offence and to find security for his good 
behaviour for two years. Dunton [p. 211] has this notice of him : 
" Mr. George Sawbridge succeeds his father in the trade, and prints many 
valuable copies. He has good skill in mihtary discipline, and made a very 
handsome figure in Captain Robinson's company." As Dunton has just 
described the elder George Sawbridge, he seems to imply that the younger 
George was his son. If we do not take the words " succeeds his father in the 
trade " literally, this is possible, and in that case George the elder and Thomas 
must have been near relatives. But Dunton may have been in error, or have 
expressed himself confusedly. 

SAWBRIDGE (hannah), bookseller in London, Bible on Ludgate Hill, 1682-6. 
Widow of George Sawbridge, the Elder, who died in 1681. Her name occurs 
in the Term Catalogues as continuing the business till 1686. [T.C. Ii. 160.] 

SAWBRIDGE (thomas), bookseller in London, (i) next the Anchor, Duck 
Lane ; (2) Three Flower de Luces, Little Britain, 1669-92. For the relationship 
between George and Thomas Sawbridge see above. Thomas Sawbridge 
began to publish in 1669, with William Leybourn's Art of Dialling. [T.C. 
I. 18.] He quickly rose to a high position in the trade, and between 1678 
and 1681 was associated with John Dunmore, T. Dring, Charles Mearne,and 
Benjamin Tooke in the publication of a series of classics which may rank 
amongst the finest examples of book production of that period. The type 
for this series came from the foundry of J. Grover. Sawbridge was a prolific 
publisher. He made his last entry in the Term Catalogues in Mich. 1692 
[T.C. 11.430], and was succeeded by his son (?) George Sawbridge, the Younger 
(q.V.).

SAYWELL (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, Red Lion in Winchester Street, 
1670. Perhaps a son of John Sa5rwell {q. v.. Dictionary, 1641-67). He 
published The Mystery of Mysteries, 1670. \T.C. i. 47.]

as publishing, with P. Bishop, Joseph Pitts's Tru£ and Faithful Account 
of the Religion and Manners of the Mahommetans, printed by Farley, 1704. 
[Dredge, p. 13.] In 1714 Score subscribed to Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy, 
and in 1724 he published Richard Izacke's Remarkable Antiquities of Exeter, 
2nd ed., 1724, which was printed for him in London. The firm was still in 
existence in 1779, when an Edward Score of Exeter is mentioned by Nichols 
as seUing libraries by auction. {Lit. Anecd. viii. 686.] 

SCOTT (jAMES), bookseller in Glasgow, 1676. One of the debtors in Andrew 
Anderson's inventory, 1676. [Bann. Misc. ll. 283 ; Aldis, p. 120.] 

SCOTT (ROBERT), bookseller in London, Prince's Arms, Little Britain, 1661-87. 
See Dictionary, 1641-67. Scott had a large connexion amongst the literary 
men and aristocracy of his day. Dr. John Cosin, Bishop of Durham, writing 
to his librarian on December 23rd, 1669, says, " Mr. Scott is now return'd out 
of France and Holland with a great many good books." [Cosin, Correspond- 
ence, II. 218.] In 1670 Scott was in correspondence with Viscount Conway 
over some books, [S.P.D. Car. II, 277, f. 186.] Another of his customers was 
Sir Joseph Williamson, and among the State Papers is a bill of Scott's amount- 
ing to £61 for books supplied to Sir Joseph. Eleven of these had chains 
attached to them, for which and fixing 145. was charged. But the best 
biographical notice of this bookseller is that written by Roger North, who 
says : " Now he [i. e. Dr. John North] began to look after books, and to lay 



SEAR. 265 

the foundation of a competent library. He dealt with Mr. Robert Scot of 
Little Britain, whose sister was his grandmother's woman ; and, upon that 
acquaintance he expected, and really had from him useful information of 
books and the editions. This Mr. Scott was, in his time, the greatest librarian 
in Europe ; for, besides his stock in England, he had warehouses at Franck- 
fort, Paris and other places and dealt by factors. After he was grown old and 
much worn by multiplicity of business he began to think of his ease and to 
leave off. Whereupon he contracted with one Mills [i. e. Adiel Mill, q. v.] of 
St. Paul's Churchyard, near £10,000 deep, and articled not to open his shop 
any more. But Mills, with his auctioneering, atlases, and projects failed, 
whereby poor Scott lost above half his means. ... He was not only an expert 
bookseller but a very conscientious good man, and when he threw up his 
trade Europe had no small loss of him. Our doctor, at one lift, bought of 
him a whole set of Greek classics, in folio, of the best editions." [Lives of the 
Right Hon. Francis North . . . the Hon. Sir Dudley North . . . and Dr. John 
North, III. 290-1.] His brother-in-law was William Wells, bookseller, with 
whom he was in partnership for a time. On January 3rd, i67f , Scott wrote to 
Williamson, stating that Sir Roger L'Estrange had ordered Wells's shop to 
be shut up, because he had sold some copies of VEscole des FiUes, which he 
had purchased of Lucas, a bookseller of Amsterdam. Scott considered 
Sir R. L'Estrange's action as " illegal, unjustifiable, and uncivill ". [S.P.D. 
Car. II, 390, f. 9.] In 1680 Scott commenced a suit against the Company of 
Stationers in respect of the share in the English stock held by William Wells 
at the time of his death ; Wells's widow had died two years before, leaving 
Scott her executor. The Company had elected Thomas Rawe in her place, 
and refused to admit George her son, or to return the £80 originally paid by 
Wells. [Chan. Proc. before 17 14, Bridges 552/10.] Adiel Mill sold off Scott's 
stock in 1687, and advertised the sale in the London Gazette for January 5 th-9th. 
He failed in 1690. The date of Scott's death is unknown. His last appearance 
is in 1 69 1, when he had a share in the seventeenth edition of Chamberlayne's 
Angliae Notitia. [T.C. II. 385.] His last entry before this was of Dr. John 
Lightfoot's Works, i68f . [T.C. II. no.] He must have sold his stock to Mill 
soon after this. His publications are not very numerous, and he was mainly 
a learned second-hand retailer.

[i. 478 ; D.N.B.'l In 167 1 he set up a second shop, in Exchange Alley ; 
his advertisements of mathematical instruments in 1672, and of a book in 
1673, give this address only. \T.C. i. 100, 151.] In 1676 and 1677 he pub- 
lished from Wapping only ; his publications being sold in Exchange Alley, 
probably at his former shop, by John Hills. [T.C. i. 256, 267.] But in 1679 
he sold his Atlas Minimus both at Wapping and in Pope's Head Alley, 
Cornhill. [T.C. i. 350.] His last appearance in the Term Catalogues [il. 114] 
is with his New System oj Geography, 1685. In 1691 he sold his Sea-Gunner, 
printed for him by H. Clark, at the Hermitage in Wapping ; he then called 
himself John Seller, senior, [b.m. 8806. aa. 12.] His chief work was The

SEYMOUR (JOHN), printer at Putney, 1669-77. On October 7th, 1669, a patent 
was granted by King Charles II to Captain John Seymour, in consideration of 
" services to us and to our Royal Father from the beginning to the end of the 
late troubles and since the restoration, for making several voyages and 
journeys beyond the seas " to print Latin books, almanacs, &c., for forty-one 
years. [Patent Roll, 21 Charles II, Pt. vi. 15.] During the proceedings before 
the Committee of the House of Lords, in 1677, in the matter of seditious 
publications, Samuel Mearne, Warden of the Company of Stationers, de- 
clared that John Seymour had set up two or three presses at Putney, and that 
there was no one who was obnoxious to the Company but fled to Seymour. 
[Hist. MSS. Comm., Report 9, App., pp. 75-8.] In the same year there is 
a record in the archives of the Stationers' Company to the effect that " certain 
members of the Company, with Randall Taylor the beadle, standing indicted 
in the Crown Office, for breaking Mr. Seymour's presses, letters and cases, and 
counsel having advised that the safest way will be to submit to a fine and not 
to plead against the King ; ordered that Randall Taylor do attend the Court 
of King's Bench, and submit to a fine for himself and the rest, in which the 
table will bear them all harmless. [Records of Stationers' Company.] Sey- 
mour transferred his patent in 167 1 to the University of Oxford. [S.P.D. 
Chas. II, 292, ff. 116, 117.]

SHARP (sm JOSHUA), stationer in London, 1681 (?)-i7i8. Youngest brother 
of Archbishop Sharp. He is thus noticed by Dunton : " The next I dealt with 
was Mr. Sharp (brother to the Archbishop of that name) ... Mr. Sharp is 



a68 SHARP— SHAW. 

a person of great honesty — very obliging in his conversation — and thrives 
so fast in his shop, that 'tis very likely we may see him riding the great horse 
[i. e. as Lord Mayor]." The prediction of Dunton was in some degree verified. 
In 1 7 13 Sharp was elected Sheriff of London and knighted. He married 
Rebecca Harvey, and died December 22, 1718. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. viii. 354.] 
Sharp does not appear to have been a publisher. He is just possibly identical 
with the following. 

SHARP (s.), stationer in London, Crooked Lane, 1692. His name occurs in the 
Term Catalogue of Easter 1692 as one of those who sold William Jordan's 
copybook. [T.C. 11. 404.] "S. Sharp " is possibly an error for J. Sharp {q.v.). 

SHARP (THOMAS), bookbinder and bookseller in London, Blackfriars, 1679. 
In 1679 he advertised The Politicks oj France by Mr.P[aul] H[ay], Marquis du 
C[hastelet], and A Letter . , . shewing that the Bishops are not to be Judges in 
Parliament in Cases Capital. Arber says in his index that Sharp was a 
bookbinder, but does not give his authority for the statement. [T.C. i. 373, 
375, 567.] 

SHARP (THOMAS), printer in London, Ivy Lane, 1722 (.?)-4 (.?). In partnership

zjo SHREWSBURY— SIMMONS. 

Catalogue of Mich. 1672 as the publisher of J. Smith's Stereotnetrie, or, the 
Art of Practical Gauging. \T.C. i. ii8.] He published many scientific and 
medical books, also a Life of Sir Matthew Hale, Lord Chief Justice, of whose 
treatise, Contemplations, Moral and Divine, he published several editions 
down to 1695. \T.C. II. 562-3.] Dunton speaks of him as alive, and says 
[pp. 221-2] : " He merits the name of ' Universal Bookseller '. . . . He keeps 
his Stock in excellent order, and will find any Book as ready as I can find 
a word in the Dictionary. ... He is a constant frequenter of Sturbridge 
Fair." 

SIMMONS (b.), bookseller in London, Three Golden Cocks, (a) at, {h) near the 
West End of St. Paul's, 1681-4. Relative of Nevill Simmons {q. v., Dictionary, 
1641-67), and succeeded to his business. His first and last entries in the 
Term Catalogues were made in 1681 and 1684. [T.C, i. 457, 11. 105.] He was 
apparently succeeded by Thomas Simmons, who published in 1685 from the 
Three Cocks in Ludgate Street, an address which probably represents the 
same house. [T.C. 11. 112.] 

SIMMONS or SYMONS (mary), printer in London, 1656-75. See Dictionary, 
1641-67. She must be the Mrs. Simmons in the 1675 List of London Printers. 

SIMMONS (nevill), the Elder, see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

SIMMONS (nevill), the Younger, bookseller in Sheffield, 1697-1702. His 
relationship to the elder Nevill Simmons is obscure. Publisher of the Rev. N. 
Drake's Sermons, also of Thomas JoUie's Vindication of the Surrey Demoniack, 
1698, as well as the writings and sermons of the Rev. Timothy Manlove. 
[T.C. II. 600, III. 92.] Hazlitt [ill. 12] records his imprint in a book of 1702. 

SIMMONS (SAMUEL), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

SIMMONS, SYMONDS, or SYMMONDS (thomas), bookseUer in Bury St.

yard, {b) Prince's Arms, Ludgate Street, 1679-84 ; (2) Three Cocks, Ludgate 
Street, 1685. 1676-85. Son of Nevill Simmons, and, like him, pubHshed for 
Baxter. He began business at Bury St. Edmunds, where he published 
a school book, called English Examples to be turned into Latine, in 1676 [T.C* 
I. 237] ; in the same year and in 1678 he published editions of a grammatical 
work by Vossius, and of Lucian's Dialogues, both by Edward Leeds, one of 
the masters of Bury School. [T.C. I. 238, 308.] Simmons left Bury St. Ed- 
mimds very shortly after this and settled in London at the Prince's Arms in 



SIMPSON. 271 

St. Paul's Churchyard, by 1679, when he published Dr. W. Simpson's History 
of Scarborough Spaw, 1679 [T.C. I. 358], and other interesting books. He 
was also the publisher of several broadsides and pamphlets on the Popish 
Plot, some with Jacob Sampson {q. v.). In 1681 he was defendant in a suit 
for assault brought against him by Bartholomew Sprint in the Court of 
Common Pleas. [C.P.R. Trin. 33 Chas. II, 2992, m. 256 r.] Again, in Hil. 
34-5 Chas. II, he stood bond for the appearance of Katherine Kirkman, 
widow [C.P.R. 3009, m. 45 r.], and in 1685 he had some commercial transaction 
with Francis Pearse, bookseller, which was afterwards the subject of an action 
in the same court. [C.P.R. Mich. 1 Jas. II, 3039, m. 309 v.] Dunton [p. 224] 
calls Simmons " a most accomplished bookseller " and praises his domestic 
virtues. In 1685 Simmons moved to the Three Cocks in Ludgate Street, 
probably the shop previously occupied by B. Simmons {q. v.) ; but nothing 
more is heard of him after that date. 

SIMPSON ( ), bookbinder in London, c. 1690. Dunton [p. 258] says that 

Simpson, a " grave and antient binder ", was recommended to him by Roberts 
the printer, as " a curious workman and a very honest man ". He supposes 
him to be nearly related to Simpson the bookseller. 

SIMPSON (ANDREW), see Symson. 

SIMPSON (jAMES), bookbinder in Edinburgh, 1670. His wife Anne was one 
of the witnesses at Major Weir's trial in 1670. [RaviUac Redivivus, London, 
1678, p. 65 ; Aldis, p. 120.] 

SIMPSON (RALPH), bookseller in London, Harp in St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1680-1704. Ralph and Richard Simpson were in partnership at the Harp, 
and one of them is mentioned in the Term Catalogue for Hil. 1680 ; but as 
the imprint to that and several other books is simply R. Simpson, it is im- 
possible to say which of them it was. They were the publishers of some of 
the works of Sir William Temple, and the first definite mention of Ralph is 
as joint publisher with Richard of that author's Miscellanea, the Second Part, 
1690. [T.C. II. 337.] In 1692 Richard moved to the Three Trouts in the 
Churchyard and is last heard of in 1698 [T.C. III. 57], but Ralph continued 
to publish until 1704. [T.C. III. 395.] The Simpsons were also publishers of 
a series of controversial tracts on the siege of Londonderry, one of which, 
A Narrative of the Siege of Londonderry, 1690, is not mentioned in the 
Term Catalogues, but is in the British Museum. [b.M. T. 1707 (i).]

SIMPSON or SYMPSON (samuel), bookseller at Cambridge, living on the site 
now occupied by the Senate House lawn, 1670-1702. His name appears on 
books from 1670 to 1702. [Bowes, Cambridge Books, nos. 142, 150, 193, 290, 
314, 354 ; T.C. II. 131.] He probably died before March 170I, when his 
house was occupied by another person. 

SIMS (JOHN), bookseller in London, King's Head at Sweeting's Alley end of 
Comhill, 1656-77. See Dictionary, 1641-67. Continued in business until

books. [T.C. I. 127-8, 295.] He was at the address given here, his third, by 
1673. He was succeeded by S. Tidmarsh. 

SKEGNES (CHRISTOPHER), bookseller in London, Golden Ball in St. Paul's 
Churchyard, 1686-7. In 1686 and 1687 he entered, either alone or with other 
booksellers, four books, of which the most important was Thevenot's Travels. 
[T.C. II. 175, 182, 193, 198.] 

SKINNER (EDWARD), bookseller in Oxford, 1697. [Madan, p. 31.] 

SLATER (j.), bookseller in London, on the west side of the Royal Exchange,

SLATER, or SLATTER (j.), bookseller at Eton, 1696-1709. Dealer in school- 
books. In 1696 he advertised an edition of Aesop for use in the school at 
Eton, and he was still there in 1709. [T.C. 11. 603, in, 627.] 

SMALL (MRS.), bookseller in Deal, Kent, 17 11. She was one of those who sold 
John Davis's Seaman' s Speculum. [T.C. III. 672 ; Post Man, March loth, i7fj.] 

SMELT (MATTHEW), see Dictionary, 1641-67.

made his last entry in 1689. [T.C. 11, 277,] 

SMITH (e.), bookseller in London, 1707 (?)-9. [T.C. m. 576, 654.] Possibly, 
but not probably, identical with the preceding. 

SMITH (FRANCIS), bookseller in London, (i) Elephant and Castle, without 
Temple Bar ; (2) Elephant and Castle, Comhill, near the Royal Exchange, 
1659 (?)-i688 (?). See Dictionary, 1641-67. Commonly called " Elephant " 
Smith. This bookseller became notorious for his strong political and religious 
views, for which he was persecuted without mercy by the Government. 
There is little doubt that he was the Francis Smith who in 1659 published 
Captain W. Bray's Plea for the Peoples Good Cause [b.m, E. 763 (7)], and he 
has left on record two pamphlets, in which is recorded his subsequent history. 
The first of these is entitled An Account of the injurious Proceedings of 
Sir George Jeffreys . . . against Francis Smith, bookseller . . . Sept. 16, 1680 ; 
upon an Indictment then exhibited against the said Francis Smith, for publishing 
a pretended Libel, entituled, An Act of Common Council for Retrenching the 
Expenses of the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs of the City of London, dfc. [1680 ?]. 
[b.m. 1872. a. I (36).] The second was called An Impartiall Account of the 
Trial of Francis Smith . . . for printing and publishing . . . [Clod-Pate's Ghost, 
by] Tom Ticklefoot. As also of the Tryal of Jane Curtis . . .for publishing . . . 
a Satyr upon Injustice, or Scroggs upon Scroggs, 1680. [b.m. 6495. i. 32.] 
Briefly summarized these are the facts which Smith records : In the year 

1659 his windows were broken and his lodgers frightened away, because he 
was suspected of being disaffected to General Monk and the Royalists. In 

1660 he was three times a prisoner in the Messenger's hands about a book 
called The Lord's Loud call to England, and his charge and damage were £50. 
At the time of Venner's rising (1657) the mob broke into his house and des- 
troyed his property, threatening to kill him and using him so badly that for 
some time afterwards he was not able to turn himself in his bed. In August 



274 SMITH. 

1661 he was thrown into the Gatehouse for printing Mirahilis Annus, and 
by that he lost his shop and trade for two years, amounting to upwards of 
£300. On another occasion he was " so often and dayly harassed too and fro 
by Mr. L'Estrange's order " that he became dangerously ill and delirious. 
During the plague (of 1665) he was living with his family at Dorking. In 
1666 Lilliecrap, a printer and one of L'Estrange's spies, went to his shop and 
warehouse near Temple Bar, and took away as many books as two porters 
could stand under, few of which he ever recovered. In 167 1 Smith was 
persecuted under the Conventicles Act, and lost his shop and trade for more 
than six months. Altogether he reckoned he had lost at least £1,400 during 
the previous twenty years. Smith stated before a Committee of the House 
of Lords in 1677 that Samuel Mearne and Robert White, acting presumably 
for the Company, had seized an impression made for Smith of Danvers' 
Infant Baptism, and, in spite of an order by Lord Arlington, refused to give 
it up ; a large edition was meanwhile printed by Joseph Downing for Thomas 
Sawbridge and Randal Taylor, with Smith's name and sign ; Mearne knew 
of this piracy, but took no steps to seize the edition. [Hist. MSS. Comm., 
Report 9, App., p. 78.] Smith was the publisher of Smith's Protestant 
Intelligence, Domestick and Foreign. The first number appeared on February 
ist, i6|f^. It recorded the publisher's indictment for publishing a pamphlet 
entitled A Speech lately made by a noble Peer of the Realm, The Grand Jury 
threw out the bill. This news-sheet contained very little foreign news and 
only occasionally inserted advertisements. Smith's last entry in the Term 
Catalogues was in Mich. 1679 ; but we know that he was in business as late 
as 1 683 . Obediah Smith {q. v.), probably his son, published at the Elephant and 
Castle in 1672-3. See also Downing (Joseph). A Francis Smith, stationer, 
was buried at Farnham in Surrey on July 6th, 1688, and was probably the 
notorious " Elephant " Smith. 

SMITH (j.), bookseller in London, Aldersgate Street, 17 10. Publisher of a 
broadside on the Sacheverell controversy entitled A Rod for a Fool's back, 17 10.

was also the publisher of The Jockey's Intelligencer of Horses arid Coaches in 
1683. 

SMITH (JOHN), bookseller in London, Lion and Crown in Russell Street, in

Temple Bar, 1672-3; (2) Black Swan, Fleet Street, 1673-80 (?); and inDaventry, 
1684-1704. 1672-1704. Probably a son of Francis ("Elephant") Smith, who 
also lived at the Elephant and Castle without Temple Bar. In 1673 Obed. 
Smith moved to the Black Swan in Fleet Street. [T.C. i. 102, 157.] Some- 
where about 1680 he appears to have left London and settled at Daventry; 
in 169I he published there C. Allestree's sermon. The Desire of All Men 
[Bodl. Serm. i (8)], and he was still living there in 1704. [T.C. III. 424,]

Began business as a publisher in 1698, and issued several of the writings of 
William Beveridge, Bishop of St. Asaph. He moved to Exeter Change in 
1708, and afterwards opened a shop in Paternoster Row, which he named, 
after his patron. Bishop Beveridge's Head. At the time of the fire at the elder 
Bowyer's printing office, Richard Smith had in that press Bishop Bull's 
Important Points of Primitive Christianity as well as an edition of Bishop 
Bull's Works ; all of which were destroyed. Bowyer made good the paper, 
although Smith had released him from any obligation to do so, and also paid 
Smith the same dividend as other sufferers received. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. 
I. 55-6.] Smith died before 1721, and was succeeded in the business by his 
widow Mary Smith. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. i. 219.] Dunton has two references 
to a Mr. Smith, but there is nothing to show to whom they apply.

276 SMITH— SOLLERS. 

SMITH (SAMUEL), bookseller in London, St. Paul's Churchyard, 1681-1703. 
Apprentice with Moses Pitt. Afterwards in partnership with Benjamin 
Walford, and bookseller to the Royal Society. Dunton declared that Smith 
dealt in foreign books and spoke French and Latin with fluency. Smith is 
said by Moses Pitt in his Cry of the Oppressed [p. 153] to have gone down to 
Portsmouth with Pitt's oppressor, Adiel Mill, and taken possession of certain 
property there. 

SMITH (w.), bookseller in Cambridge, 1706-31. His name appears on Poor 
Law Overseers' Forms (in the Great St. Mary's Church Books), 1708-31. 
A Mr. Smith, bookseller, appears in the Rate Book of St. Botolph Church, 
March 172I, for 10^. In 1706 there appears to have been a charge against 
him " for selling books and strong drinks ", and depositions of Cambridge 
stationers were made February 4th and March 23rd concerning this charge. 

SMITH (WILLIAM), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

SMITHURST (benjamin), bookseller, in Launceston, 1693-1700 ; (?) and in 
Plymouth, 1714. 1693-1714 (?). It seems highly probable that the Benjamin 
Smithurst who compiled a Peerage and Baronetage in 1689, under the title 
of Britain's Glory, was none other than the Benjamin Smithurst who in 1693 
and 1700 published sermons by John Hill and J. R., Cornish clergy. [T.C. 
II. 475, III. 169.] Smithurst, bookseller in Plymouth, subscribed in 1714 for 
Walker's Sufferings of the Clergy. His identity with Benjamin is not more 
than probable. 

SNOWDEN (THOMAS), printer in London, 1678 (?)-i68o. Probably the T. S. 
who printed for Thomas Moore in 1678. His full name is only known from 
An Account of the New Sheriffs holding their Office, 1680. [b.m. 816. m. 9 (61).] 

SOLINGEN (JOSHUA van), printer in Edinburgh, 1680-5. One of the Dutch

SOLLERS (ROBERT), bookseller in London, (i) Flying Horse, St. Paul's Church- 
yard, 1677 ; (2) King's Arms, Ludgate Street, 1678 ; (3) King's Arms and

the Term Catalogue for Easter 1677. He dealt in plays, novels, poems, and 



SOUTHALI^-SOWLE, §ij 

divinity. Dunton [p. 292] refers to him as " Country SoUars ", perhaps imply- 
ing that he suppUed the chapmen or else that he went to country fairs himself. 
It is possible that he had a shop at Rochester in Kent, as Edward 
Brown's sermon at the Kentish Feast of November i6th, 1699, **^ advertised 
in the Flying Post of December 2nd, to be sold, amongst others, by " Mr. SoUers 
in Rochester ". His name, however, does not appear in the imprint to the 
book. 

SOUTH ALL (RICHARD), bookseller in Stafford, 1732. Publisher of a sermon by 
W. Jervis entitled The duty of praying for Princes, 1722, 8vo. [B.M. 225.

Harrow in Cornhill, 1684-91. Began as a publisher of theology in Trin. 1684 
[T.C. II. 80], in which year he either moved, or changed his sign from the 
" Plough " to the " Harrow ". In 1690 he issued The Great Question, or, how 
Religion, Property and Liberty are to be best secured, [b.M. T. 1707 (2).] The 
announcement of this in Trin. 1691 [T.C. II. 371] is the last that is known 
of him. 

SOUTHBY (RICHARD), bookseller in London, Golden Fleece in Fleet Street, 
1693. Advertised a set of tables of the sovereigns of Europe, and also a 
treatise on the law of bankruptcy. [T.C. II. 440, 478.]

Inn in Chancery Lane, 1673-5 > (2) New Inn Gate, without Temple Bar, 1679. 
1673-9. Began business as a publisher in 1673 when, in partnership with 
Israel Harrison, he reissued J. Smith's England's Improvement Reviv'd of 
1670. Harrison dropped out of the partnership after this, and Southwood 
continued alone as a publisher of a few divinity books and political pamphlets. 
He gave evidence before the Committee of the House of Lords in 1676-7 that 
he had received from Dr. Carey the MS. of The Long Parliament Dissolved, 
which he gave to Nathaniel Thompson to print. [Hist. MSS. Comm., Report 9, 
App., p. 72.] His last entry in the Term Catalogues was in 1679. [T.C. i. 356.] 

SOWLE (ANDREW), fee Dictionary, 1641-67.

Meeting House in White-Hart Court in Gracious [Gracechurch] Street ; and 
at the Bible in Leadenhall Street, 1695-1746. Printer for the Quakers. 



9^9 SOWLE-^PICER. 

Daughter of Andrew Sowle ; born January 29th, i66f . She succeeded her 
father, who died in 1695. Dunton [pp. 222-3] says : " She is both a Printer 
as well as a Bookseller, and the daughter of one ; and understands her Trade 
very well, being a good Compositor herself. . , . She keeps herself unmarried." 
Three years later, however, in 1706, she married Thomas Raylton. Her 
mother, Jane Sowle, and from 17 15 the latter's assigns, continued the business. 
Tace survived her husband twenty- three years and died in 1746. 

SPEED (ANNE), bookseller in London, Three Crowns in Exchange Alley, over 
against Jonathan's Coffee House in Cornhill, 1 705-11 (?). Probably wife of

tracts. Her first entry in the Term Catalogues was made in Mich. 1705. 
[r.C. III. 476.] 

SPEED (SAMUEL), bookseller in London, 1658-70. See Dictionary, 1641-67. 
Still in business in 1670, when a catalogue of books sold by him occurs at the

Crowns, Cornhill, near the Royal Exchange, 1690-1714 (?). 1689-1714. 
He was probably son or brother of Samuel Speed. His name first appears 
in the Term Catalogue for Easter 1689, when he advertised two books on 
shorthand by Thomas Shelton, and Thomas Farnaby's Index Rhetoricus. 
\T.C. II. 263.] Dunton [pp. 218-9] says : " He has the honour to print for 
Sir William Dawes, Dr. Smith and other eminent churchmen. He is a very 
modest quiet man." His name occurs in the Term Catalogues for the 
last time in Mich. 1707. \T.C. ill. 577.] A list of eleven books printed for 
him is to be found at the end of L. Smith's Knowledge and Virtue, 1702. 
[Bodl. Serm. 19 (4).] In 1714 he was among the subscribers to Walker's 
Sufferings of the Clergy. Anne Speed {q. v.) published at the second of Thomas's 
addresses in his lifetime. 

SPENCER (JOHN), printer in London, 1684. He appears as defendant in an 
action for debt brought by Sara Reeve, widow. [C.P.R. Trin. i Jas. II, 
3036, m. 195 r.] He was probably not a master. 

SPICER (JOHN), bookseller in London, 1682. Only known from a poem. The

in 1682. [b.m. 11631. bbb. 3.] 



SPILLER— SPRINT, 479 

SPILLER (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, 1696. David Edwards, a printer,

Spiller. [Chan. Proc., before 1714, Collins 486/100.] 

SPOTTISWOOD (JOHN), printer (?), Edinburgh, 1706. " In 1706, Mr. John 
Spotiswood Advocate, and professor of the Law, brought home a neat little 
house [sic] for printing his law books : But in a little time after, dispos'd of 
it to Mr. Robert Freebaim bookseller." [Watson, p. i8.] No books bearing 
Spottiswood's name in the imprint have been noted. 

SPRINT (BARTHOLOMEW), bookseller in London, 1681. Only known as plaintiff 
in an action for assault, brought by him against a number of booksellers and 
printers in London and Oxford. The details are wanting, and nothing is 
known of his relation to the other Sprints, booksellers of London. [C.P.R. 
Trin. 33 Chas. II, 2992, m. 256.] 

SPRINT (benjamin), bookseller in London, Blue Bell, Little Britain, 1709-37. 
Son of Samuel Sprint, who left him half his books, bound and unbound, and 
half his copyrights, desiring him to continue with his brother John ; he was in

in Duck Lane in 1670, in partnership with George Calvert. [T.C. i. 35.] In 
1672 he set up for himself at the Bell, in Little Britain, and in 1676 his sign 
became the Blue Bell in Little Britain. In 1698 he took his son John into 
partnership. They were the publishers of the Index Villaris, and in 1700 
a translation of the Works of Scarron, " illustrated with copper cuts." 
Samuel Sprint died in 1707, his will being proved on April 28th. He left three 
sons, John, Benjamin, and Samuel. To his son Benjamin he left half his books,

bound and unbound, and half his copyrights, and desired him to continue in 
partnership with his brother John. [P.C.C. 94, Poley.] He served the office 
of Under Warden of the Company in 1 700-1, and Upper Warden in 1704-5. 
Dunton [p. 209] says of him : " Mr. Samuel Sprint, senior, thrives much in 
trade, and is punctual and honest : he has been very fortunate in several 
engagements. He printed ' Mr. Fox of Time ', ' Mr, Doolittle on the Sacra- 
ments,' and was engaged the same way for Mr. Steele, and other eminent 
authors." 

STAGG (JOHN), bookseller in London, Westminster Hall, i7i6(.?)-46. The 
following notices in the General Advertiser of September 20th and 27th, 1746, 
contain all the information met with concerning this bookseller : " Yesterday 
morning [September 19th], died, at his house in Old Palace Yard, Westmin- 
ster, after a long and tedious indisposition in the 52nd year of his age, Mr. John 
Stagg, who has been near 30 years an eminent bookseller in Westminster

Still at work in 1689. A list of books printed for him appears at the beginning 
oi Jesuitical Aphorisnies, 1679. G. Grafton was at Starkey's house, the Mitre 
in Fleet Street, by 1687 [r.C. II. 202] ; Starkeyat this time appears to have 
been in partnership with Chiswell. \T.C. II. 248, 255, 274.] 

STATIONERS, Society of, in Edinburgh, see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

STEPHENS (ANTHONY), bookseller in Oxford, near the Theatre, 1685. Mis- 
cellany Poems and Translations by Oxford Hands was printed for him in this

printed for him at the " Theater-Press ", but paid no University dues. 
[Collections, II. 211-12 ; Madan, p. 31.] 

STEPHENS (PHILEMON), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

STEPHENS, or STEVENS (Robert), printer in London, 1668 (?)-i 700 (?). 
This man, who does not appear to have exercised his trade as a printer, was 
appointed " messenger " and " constable " by the Company of Stationers and 
was in consequence cordially hated by his brother printers, who gave him the 
nickname of " Robin Hog ". He was employed to hunt out secret presses, 
and figures in nearly all the prosecutions of that period. He sometimes 
met with resistance. Francis Smith states that in December 1679, 
" Mr. Stevens and a constable came to his shop with a general search warrant, 
but as it did not state his name or crime, he dared them at their peril to 
touch him or anything in his shop." In 1681 Stephens was defendant in an 
action for assault brought against him by S. Lee. [C.P.R. 2994, m. 1093 v.] 
In 1692, having discovered a private press at the house of Thomas Topham, 
in Shoreditch, Stephens was allowed £4 for his expenses and service, with 
liberty to prosecute the landlord of the house for the £5 due by the Act for 
his own benefit. [Records of the Stationers' Company.] Moses Pitt, in his 
Cry of the Oppressed, also mentions the activities of Robert Stephens. 

STEWART (GEORGE), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1716-34. The Freeholder of

he sold books printed by Ruddiman. 

STEWART (ROBERT), bookseller in Glasgow, 1662 (?)-76. One of the debtors 
in A. Anderson's inventory of 1676. The Robert Stewart in Glasgow, debtor 
to G. Lithgow in 1662, is probably the same. [Aldis, p. 121.] 

STOKOE (LUKE), bookseller in London, (i) Golden Key and Bible at Charing 
Cross ; (2) Golden Key, against the Mews Gate, Charing Cross ; (3) Coventry 
Court, Haymarket, 1700 (?)-27. In 1700 " L. Stoley " is recorded by Arber 
[ill. 182] as publishing a divinity book at the first of the addresses given 
above. This appears to be an error for L. Stokoe. In conjunction with 
George Harris he published a small volume of verse called Poems on Several 
Occasions. Together with some Odes in Imitation of Mr. Cowley's Stile and 
Manner in 1703. In 1725 he took subscriptions for Francis Mason's Vindica- 
tion of the Church of England, and in 1727 he issued two sale catalogues* 
[Nichols, Lit. Anecd. I. 329, III. 664.]

her name appears in the imprints to sermons by J. Oliver, Prebendary of 
Chester. [Cooke, Bibl. Cestr., p. 26 ; B^. 226. g. 13 (8).] 

STORY (EDWARD), bookseller in Cambridge. See Dictionary, 1641-67. To that 
notice should be added that he was buried in Great St. Mary's February 5th, 
i69§. By his will he bequeathed his real and personal estate to his son 
Edward Story (M.B. and Fellow of Magdalene College), and, if he should die 
without issue, to trustees to erect ten almshouses in the town of Cambridge. 
The son died without issue about 17 10, and the almshouses were erected 
about 1729. These almshouses, like those founded by bequest of another 
bookseller, Henry Wray {q.v., Dictionary, 1 557-1640) are still in existence, 
and used for the object for which they were founded. [Cooper's Memorials 
oj Cambridge, III. 175, 310.] 

STORY (JOHN), bookseller in Newcastle-on-T5me, 1685-6. Took up his free-

Nichols [Lit. Anecd.] notes several of the important books which Strahan 
published. In or about 1740 he was one of six booksellers contracting with 
the Society for the Encouragement of Learning. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. il. 96.] 

STREATER, or STREATOR (john), see Dictionary, 1641-67. 

STREATER (s.), printer in London, 1677. Only known from Giles Fletcher's 
Israel Redux, 1677. [Haz. II. 222.] Possibly a misprint for J(ohn) Streater. 

STREATOR (Joseph), printer in London, 1688. Only known from the imprint 
to Sylvia's Revenge, 1688. [Haz. II. 715,] Perhaps successor to John Streator, 
who disappears in the previous year. 

STURTON (JOHN), bookseller in London, at the Post Office at the Middle 
Temple in Fleet Street, 1696-8. Publisher, with A. Bosvill, of The Delights oj

SWINTOUN (GEORGE), printer and bookseller in Edinburgh, 1649-83. See 
Dictionary, 1641-67. Swintoun appears to have continued till at least 1683. 
His name is found on the title page of a Confession of Faith of that date in the 
British Museum. [Ames ill. 643.] 

SWINTOUN (JOHN), printer in Edinburgh, 1675-81. Printed several books

bered as the publisher in 17 19 of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, by which he is 
said to have cleared £1,000. He died in 1723, and appointed as one of his 
executors John Osborne ; the latter induced his son-in-law Thomas Longman

218] ; in the intervening years he gives his address in the Term Catalogues 
simply as "in Duck Lane". The mass of his publications consisted of ballads 
and other chapbooks ; they were published by a syndicate in which he was 
a partner, and were not advertised in the Term Catalogues. T. Passenger, 
F. Coles, T. Vere, J. Wright and J. Clarke were the other regular members ; 
W. Whit wood appears more seldom. An advertisement of books sold by

(i) next the Cross Keys in Fetter Lane ; (2) at the entrance into the Old 
Spring Garden, near Charing Cross. 1666-88. See Dictionary, 1641-67. 
Printer for the Nonconformists, and also for the Roman Catholics. In 1673 
he is found in London printing a Romanist book in partnership with T. Rat- 
cliffe. [T.C. I. 136.] He was constantly in trouble with the Company. In 

1676 he was committed to Newgate for printing seditious pamphlets. In 

1677 the Company ordered that he should be indicted at the next Quarter 
Sessions for printing part of a Mass Book in French. [Records of the Stationers' 
Company.] In the Report of the Proceedings of the House of Lords Committee 
in February 167^ it was stated that Thompson had printed a pamphlet. 
The Long Parliament Dissolved, the type having been examined with Thomp- 
son's types and found to agree in everything. [Hist. MSS. Comm,, 
Report 9, App., pp. 69-78.] He next started a news-sheet called Domestick 
Intelligence, but in 1679 he altered the title to The True Domestick Intelligence, 
It was a rival sheet to that issued by Benjamin Harris, with whom Thompson 
was always at war. In i68o he was committed to the Gatehouse for being 
privy to the conspiracy of the apprentices to levy war against the King 
{Protestant Domestic Intelligence, April 2, 1680], and in 1684 he was again in 
trouble for printing The Prodigal Returned Home. An account of the pro- 
ceedings against him on that occasion was published as a broadside by 
A. Banks. [b.m. 515. 1. 2 (94).] In 1686 The Compleat Dancing Master was 
announced [T.C. II. 167-8] as printed for him ; it is doubtful whether this 
implies that he was a bookseller. Thompson was dead in 1688, when the 
Stationers' Company ordered his widow to lay down the trade of printing 
in obedience to the Act of Parliament. [Records of the Company of Stationers.]

Rochester's Poems. [Haz. II. 520.] In 1686 he was in Boston, Mass. Dunton

him. He is probably also the same person mentioned by Dunton [p. 293] 
as " musical " Thorncomb. 

THORNICROFT (thomas), bookseller in London, Sun, St. Paul's Church- 
yard, 1663-72. See Dictionary, 1641-67. In business till 1672 ; in this and

he published a third edition of Peter's Artificial Versifying, a new way to make 
Latin verses. [T.C. II. 280.] Referred to by Dunton [p. 292] as " travelling " 
Tidmarsh, no doubt because he attended country fairs.

TOMPSON (DANIEL), printer in Dublin, Coles Alley, Castle Street, 17 14-15. 
Four or five books printed by him are extant, one being Thomas Sheridan's 
Latin Grammar. 

TOMPSON (RICHARD), bookseller in London, Sun, Bedford Street, 1669. See Dic- 
tionary, 16^1-6']. Sold Alexander Browne's i4r5 PzV/on'a. He may be identical 
with — Tompson, bookseller, who had a stall in Westminster Hall some years 
later. The second address given by Arber \T.C. i. Index] is evidently a con- 
fusion with R. Tonson, who carried on business under Gray's Inn Gate. 

TOMSON, or THOMPSON (William), bookseller in [Market] Harborough, 
1655-69. See Dictionary, 1641-67. In 1669 he published Joseph Bentham's 
Disswasive from Error much Increased. 

TONGE (GEORGE), bookseller in Warwick, 1682. In this year Evan Tyler of 
London (g. v.) left him £50. 

TONSON (JACOB) I, bookseller in London, (i) Judge's Head in Chancery Lane, 
near Fleet Street, 1678-98 ; (2) in Gray's Inn Gate, next Gray's Inn Lane, 
1700-10 ; (3) Shakespeare's Head, opposite Catherine Street in the Strand, 
1710-20. 1677-1720, Younger brother of Richard Tonson (q.v.) and second 
son of Jacob Tonson, " a barber-surgeon in Holbom ". He served his appren- 
ticeship with Thomas Basset, to whom he was articled in 1670, and took up 
his freedom on December 20th, 1677. He settled at once at the Judge's Head, 
and in Hil. 1678 shared with his brother and with Bentley and Magnes the 
publication of Prechac's novel. The Heroin Musqueteer, his name only appear- 
ing on the third and fourth volumes. \T.C. i. 300, 320, 330 ; Esdaile, p. 291.] 
He soon began to publish plays, and in 1679, with Abel Swalle, of whom 
a probably fabulous tradition asserts that he borrowed the purchase money, 
Jie published his first book for Dryden, Troilus and Cressida, In 1684 he 
started the celebrated Miscellany Poems, edited and largely written by 
Dryden, and commonly called Tonson's Miscellany. Another very important 
acquisition by Tonson was Paradise Lost, which he purchased in two instal- 
ments in 1683 and 1690, Between 1698 and 1700 [T.C. m. 57, 171] he moved 
from Chancery Lane to Gray's Inn Gate, no doubt succeeding his brother, 
whose name disappears from the Term Catalogues in 1689. The latter's son 
Jacob probably joined his uncle now ; he had possibly been latterly keeping 
up a retail business at Gray's Inn Gate. Tonson followed up his earlier 
successes by publishing for the rising school of literary men. In 1705 he

published Remarks on Several Parts oj Italy for Addison, whom he had met in 
Holland ; Steele seems to have acted for him as a " publisher's reader ". 
He also published Cato, 17 13. In 1709 he secured Pope's Pastorals for his 
sixth Miscellany. From about 1700 he was secretary to the newly founded 
literary Kitcat Club, and it shortly took to meeting at his house. In 17 10 he 
made his second move, to the Strand. [Tatler, October 14th.] He retired 
about 1720, in favour of his nephew, and lived till 1737 at Ledbury. Tonson 
was accused by Dryden of meanness, and is caricatured by him in the well- 
known lines : 

With leering look, bull-fac'd, and freckled fair 
With two left legs, with Judas-coloured hair. 
And frowzy pores, that taint the ambient air. 

Dunton comments [p. 216] on the harshness of Tonson's critical judgements.

TONSON (JACOB) II, bookseller, bookbinder and printer in London, (i) Gray's 
Inn Gate ; (2) Shakespeare's Head, opposite Catherine Street in the Strand, 
1700 (.'*)-35. Nephew of Jacob Tonson I {q. z;.), and probably son of Richard. 
He may have succeeded his father soon after 1689, but is first known as in 
partnership with his uncle after 1700. It was Jacob II who in 1712 bought 
half the rights in the Spectator, vols, i-vii, from Addison and Steele. In or 
about 1720 he succeeded his uncle, and continued to publish important 
literary works tor Steele, Pope, Theobald, &c. From his will it appears that 
he was a bookbinder, a stationer and a printer, as well as a bookseller ; his 
printing business was in partnership with John Watts, in Covent Garden 
they are given as " well-affected " by Negus in 1724. He died on December 
2nd, 1735, and was succeeded by his son Jacob III. \D.N.B. ; Nichols, Lit.

He is last heard of in Easter 1689. [T.C. Ii. 263]. Jacob Tonson took over

the shop between 1698 and 1700 ; possibly Richard had only left publishing 
to his brother and confined himself to retail bookselling. 

TOOK ( ), printer in London, Old Bailey, 1724. Classed by Negus as a 
" highflier ". 

TOOKE (benjamin) I, printer in Dublin, 1669-85 (?) ; bookseller in London 
(i) Anchor, Duck Lane, 1669 ; (2) Ship, St. Paul's Churchyard, 1670- ; (3) 
Middle Temple Gate, Fleet Street. 1669-1716. According to Timperley, this 
celebrated bookseller was bom about 1642, and is supposed to have been the 
son of the Rev. Thomas Tuke, vicar of St. Olave's, Old Jewry ; but the 
bookseller always spelt his name as Took or Tooke. He served his appren- 
ticeship with John Crooke, and was admitted a freeman of the Company of 
Stationers in February i66f. He succeeded Crooke in 1669 as King's 
Printer in Dublin,and,like him,combined the office withibookselling in London. 
The last entry in the Term Catalogues of a book printed by him in Dublin 
was made in 1685. He began as a London bookseller by advertising two books,

Paul and Isaac, his grandson [Paul II died February ist, 1802], and Mr. Elmsly 
successively carried on the same trade in the same house till nearly the end

authority for the statement that Paul Vaillant died on October 14th, 1739, 
aged 67 years, and as Vaillant would only have been 14 in 1686, it seems more 
likely that 1696 was the date at which he opened his shop in the Strand. He

WALFORD (j.), bookseller in London, St. Paul's Churchyard, 17 10. Publisher 
of a broadside for Sacheverell in 1710. [b.m. T. 100* (232).] This may be

In May of that year Walker procured a Royal licence to print some forty 
Romanist books. According to Wood he had Abraham Woodhead's Two 
Discourses, 1687, " printed at Lichfield's, and some scholars . . . getting the

Church Government (part 5)." The practical printer who worked this press 
was Henry Cruttenden {q. v.). At the Revolution Walker fled, but was

Aberdeen merchant. In 1685-6 he acquired the printing house of van 
Solingen and Colmar \see Lindsay (D.) and his partners], and occupied the 
same premises in the Grassmarket, though no book of Watson's with this 
imprint has been found. In February 1686, his premises having beep broken 
into by the populace and his workmen (including Thomas Noble) ill-treated, 
he was taken under Royal protection and his press set up in the precincts of 
Holyrood Palace. He was also appointed Printer to the Royal Family and 
Household, and granted other privileges. Watson died in 1687, his will being 
r^stered on December 21st. He left a son, James Watson the Younger, 
and was succeeded by Peter Bruce. [Aldis, p. 123.]

appointed Queen's printer in conjunction with Freebairn and Baskett ; this 
gift was forfeited in 17 16, and a new one issued in favour of Baskett and 
Mrs. Anderson. In 17 13 he published his History of the Art of Printing. The 



304 WATSON— WATTS. 

Preface is the only valuable part of this work ; it contains notices of many 
contemporary Scottish printers, and has been edited separately byMr. W. J. 
Couper (1913). Died September 24th, 1722. His widow, afterwards Mrs. 
Heriot, died in August 1731. [Aldis, p. 123 ; W. J. Couper, " James Watson, 
King's Printer ", Scot. Hist. Rev., April 1910, and " Watson's History of 
Printing ", Library, October 1910.] 

WATSON (RALPH), senior and junior, booksellers in Bury St. Edmunds, 1686- 
1 7 14. The elder is in W. C. B.'slist of provincial booksellers as in business in 1686. 
[iV. 6* Q. nth ser. I. 304.] His name occurs in an advertisement in The Post 
Man, February 26th-28th, i7o|,as selling a plaster. He published school- 
books for the use of Bury school in 1705, and in Easter 1707 Francis Hutchin- 
son's sermon preached at the Assizes in that town on March 25th, 1707. 
[T.C. III. 468, 543.] " Ralph Watson junior " subscribed in 17 14 for Walker's 
Sufferings of the Clergy. It is not clear when he succeeded his father. 

WATTS (JOHN), printer in London, Little Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields, 
1700 (?)-63. This was one of the most important printing houses in London 
in the first half of the eighteenth century, and was the school in which many 
eminent printers learnt the art. Nichols says : " The fame of Mr. John Watts 
for excellently good printing will endure as long as any public library shall 
exist. ' The duodecimo editions of Maittaire's Classicks ' ex officina lacobi 
Tonson et lohannis Watts ' would alone have been sufficient to have im- 
mortalized his memory, both for correctness and neatness. But there are many 
works of still higher importance ; Clarke's Caesar for example ; and several 
beautiful volumes of English Classicks." [Lit. Anecd. I. 292.] Among those 
who worked in this office was Thomas Gent {q. v.) and Chalmers, the father of 
James Chalmers, printer to the City of Aberdeen ; but the best known of all 
was Benjamin Franklin, who on finding himself stranded in London, first 
entered the printing office of Palmer and afterwards that of Watts, where 
he acted as compositor during the remainder of his stay in London. John 
Watts was one of the patrons of William Caslon the first, and lent him £100 
to make a start. He died September 26th, 1763, aged 85. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd. 
III. 739.] 

WATTS (JOSEPH), bookseller in London,(i) Gilded Acorn, St.Paul's Churchyard,

by Charles Bettesworth. [Bodl. Sermons, 2 (17).] He was still in business 
in 1714, when he published a sermon by M. Woodford. [b.m. 225. h. 3 (15).] 

WEBSTER (THOMAS), bookseller in Cambridge, 1701-22. His name appears on 
a sermon by Dr. John Cornwall, preached May i8th, 1701. [Bowes I, 
Cambridge Books, no. 349.] He lived (i) on the site of what is now the Senate 
House lawn, moving in 1704 to (2) a house in the High Street facing Great St. 
Mary's Church, two doors to the right of the " Green Dragon " (previously 
occupied by John Creed, bookseller), where he died in 1722. 

WEEKS ( ), bookseller (?) at Maidstone, 1699. His name appears in an 
advertisement in The Flying Post, December 2nd, 1699, of the publication of 
Edward Brown's sermon preached at the Kentish Feast on November i6th, 
1699. It does not appear in the imprint to the book. 

WEIR (ALEXANDER), bookseller in Edinburgh, 1670. His wife Margaret was 
sister[-in-law?] of Major Weir, and a witness at his trial ini67o. [Aldis,p. 123.]

3o6 WELD— WELLS. 

Chalmer and Dr. Abercromby's Discourse of Wit. [T.C. II. 137.] In i686 he 
published an anonymous work on witchcraft. [T.C. II. 159.] At the end of 
R. Adams's Earthly and Heavenly Building, 1690, is an advertisement of four 
books printed for him. The last entry under his name in the Term Catalogues 
was Bishop Burnet's The Life of God in the Soul of Man, I'joo. [T.C. in. 203.] 

WELLINGTON (m.), bookseller in London, 17 18-22. See Wellington (Richard)I. 

WELLINGTON (richard) I, (i) Lute, St. Paul's Churchyard, 1693-9; 
(2) Dolphin and Crown, St. Paul's Churchyard, 1699-1709 (?). 1693-1709 (?). 
Made his first entry in the Term Catalogues in 1693. [T.C. 11. 475.] In 1704 
the Company of Stationers brought an action in Chancery against him and 
John MinshuU of Chester, for importing and selling The Psalms in Metre. 
Wellington professed ignorance of the Company's privilege. [Chan. Proc. 
before i7i4,Hamilton 320/40, 319/77; Z,iirary,2ndser.,lV.373-83.] Welling- 
ton was the publisher of many plays, romances, and the like. He was 
publishing in 1709. [T.C. ill. 654.] He moved to the Dolphin and Crown 
between Trin. and Mich. 1699. [T.C. III. 141, 154.] Edd. 2 (?)-5, 1696-1705, 
of Mrs. Behn's collected Histories and Novels were printed for R. Wellington ; 
ed. 6, 1718, printed by J. D. for M. Wellington ; ed. 7, 1722, printed by J. D. 
for M. P. ; and ed. 8, 1735, ^^^ ^' Wellington among others. [Esdaile, p. 160] 
Nichols [Lit. Anecd. 11. 304] mentions Richard Wellington as the publisher in 
1740 of Edward Spelman's translation of Xenophon. From these facts it 
would seem probable that there were three booksellers of the name: (i) 
Richard I, who died between 1709 and 17x8 ; (2) " M." (perhaps his widow, 
and subsequently wife of some bookseller with a surname beginning with P.), 
who published the sixth and seventh editions of Mrs. Behn in 1718 and 1722; 
and (3) Richard II, who was at work in 1735-40. Dunton [p. 212] says that 
Wellington " has the intimate acquaintance of several excellent pens, and 
therefore can never want copies ; and trust him for managing and improving 
them. He has a pretty knack at keeping his word and I expect to see him 
master of the Company at least, if not a gold chain about his neck, before he 
dies ". 

WELLS (GEORGE), bookseller in London, Sun, St. Paul's Churchyard, 1677-87. 
This bookseller published some interesting books. He is first met with in 
1677 as selling a French Liturgy. In 1678 he published the second edition of 
Paul Festeau's NouveUe Gramaire [sic] Anglois. [T.C. 1. 323.] In the following 



WELLS— WELSH. 307 

year (1679) he was joint publisher with J. Robinson of Dr. A. Tuckney's 
Praelectiones Theologicae, and in 1680 they were also the publishers of a French 
and English vocabulary, compiled by Jacob Villiers, master of a French 
school in Nottingham. [T.C. i. 386.] In 1682 Wells alone published Anti- 
quitates Ecclesiae Orientalis, by Cardinal Barberino and other writers 
[T.C. I. 473], and shared with Littlebury and Scott in the publication of 
Chamberlayne's Angliae Notitia. Wells was also the publisher of Isaac 
BsLTTovf'sLectiones and of a French version of a sermon of Calamy's [r.C.ii.6o], 
and held a share in Torriano's Italian Dictionary, 1684. [T.C. II. 66.] In 1686, 
in company with Abel Swalle, he published a translation from the French 
of Varrilas' History of William de Croy. [T.C. II. 177.] Another work of con- 
siderable value published by Wells was The Universal Historical Biblio- 
theque, or an Account of most of the considerable books, printed in all languages, 
in . . . January and February, i68f . This work ran to three issues and then 
ceased. Finally, in Mich. 1687, he was part-publisher of Florio's Vocabolario 
Italiano e Inglese. [T.C. ii. 214.] 

WELLS (JOHN), bookseller and bookbinder in London, St. Paul's Alley, 1687- 
17 16 (?). Defendant in an action for trespass brought by — Gardner, widow. 
In this he is described as bookbinder. [C.P.R. Hil. 2-3 Jas. II (1686-7), 
3052, m. 49 v.] In Easter 1691 he entered in the Term Catalogue The Title 
of a Thorough Settlement examined. [T.C. II. 361.] Perhaps identical with 
the John Wells who in 17 16 published The Case of the Five Rioters. [Bodl« 
Fol. o. 662 (31).] 

WELLS (r.), bookseller in London, Hand and Sceptre, P'leet Street, over against 
St. Dunstan's Church, 1686. In partnership with Robert Kettlewell in 
June 1686, when they published several theological pamphlets. [T.C. 11. 166.] 

WELLS (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, see Dictionary, 1641-67 ; also T.C. I. 
10-120. 

WELLS (WILLIAM), bookseller in Oxford, 1719-32. [Madan, p. 32.] 

WELSH (ANDREW), printer in Cork, Castle Street, 1715 (?)-25. This printer's 
name is first found, jointly with Thomas Cotton's, upon a folio sheet, probably 
of 1715, The Freeholder's Answer to the Pretender's Declaration. It was sold 
by John Redwood (q. v.). Welsh printed alone a similar sheet in 1722 
[Bibl. Lind. Broadsides, 1221] and John Knapp's Cork Almanack for 

3C 2 



3o8 WELSH— WHITE. 

1723 and again for 1724. He was then in Castle Street. In 1725 he printed a 
stout 4to in French, M. Laval's Les Veritez 6*<:. de la Religion Chritienne. 

WENT (SAMUEL), bookseller in Stroud, 1722. He and G. Harris sold J. Blanch's 
History of Great Britain from the Tower of Babel, printed at Gloucester by 
Raikes and Dicey. 

WEST ( ), bookseller in London (?), 1703. Mentioned disparagingly by 
Dunton [p. 356], who says that he had been apprenticed to Samuel Manship, 
but " sued out his indentures ". 

WEST (GEORGE), bookseller in Oxford, c. 1650-1707. Mr. Madan [p. 32] says that 
West died in 1695 ; but he and Antony Peisley were Oxford agents in 1697 
and 1699 for two auction catalogues, Bibliotheca selectissima (M. Harding's) 
and Bibliotheca Andertoniana. [b.M. 821. i. 2(11, 12).] In 1 700-1 Bullord, 
for whom he sold the latter, was employing DoUive ; but West was in business 
as late as 1707, for on September 17th of that year Heame [11. 46] speaks of 
a book being " bought of old George West the bookseller ". 

WH ALLEY, or WHALE Y (JOHN ?), printer in Dublin, 1700-24. He was an 
almanac maker in Dublin in 1691, but in 1700 he had become, in addition, 
a printer, and printed his own almanac for that year. He continued to 
print occasional broadsides till 17 17. He has been described, not unreasonably, 
as a quack. He died in or about 1724, and his will is lodged in the Dublin 
Diocesan Court. 

WHISTLER (EDWARD), bookseller and bookbinder in Oxford, 1710-22. In 
March 17 16 he was elected Inferior Beadle of Arts. Hearne refers to him 
fv. 189] as a " very silly conceited Fellow, but fit enough for some dull Heads of 
Houses ", and further records that he was University Verger and a book- 
binder. He was still living in 1722. [Madan, p. 32.] 

WHITE (grace), printer in York, Coffee House Yard, near the Star in Stonegate, 
1 7 16-2 1. Second wife and widow of John White, senior. Besides books she 
founded and printed the York Mercury (no. i, February 23rd, 17 if, which 
was edited and sold by T. Hammond, the Quaker bookseller, till Gent 
quarrelled with him. Mrs. White died in January 1721, and was succeeded by 
Charles Bourne, her husband's grandson. [Davies, pp. 132-9.] 

WHITE (henry), bookseller in London, Three Bibles, Minories, 1677-80 (?). 
In 167 f he advertised John Ryther's Looking Glass for the Wise and Foolish, 
Godly and Ungodly. \T.C. 1. 265.J Succeeded in 1680 by John White {q. v.). 



WHITE. 309 

WHITE (JOHN), bookseller in London, Three Bibles, Minories, 1680. Probably 
identical with the John White who on Bulkley's death went to York and 
settled there as a printer. He may have been the son of Henry White, 
but all that is known of his business in London is the publication of J. Ryther's 
Hue and Cry of Conscience in i6|^. [T.C. I. 380.] Dunton {p. 292] mentions 
" Presbyterian (alias Minories) White " and, after a number of other names, 
" Hue and Cry White " ; he may be thus distinguishing Henry and John. 
WHITE (JOHN), senior, printer at York, Coffee-House-Yard, over against the 
Star in Stonegate, 1680-1716. The year that Stephen Bulkley died (i68o) 
John White, " late of London," settled at York. He was perhaps the John 
White who is found at the Three Bibles in the Minories in 1680 ; but he must 
have had some previous acquaintance with York and the family of Thomas 
Broad the printer, as the first thing he did upon his arrival was to marry Broad's 
daughter Hannah on November 9th, 1680, upon which Alice Broad, the widow, 
retired from business in favour of White. In November 1688, soon after the 
landing of William of Orange, White had the boldness to print at York the 
Prince's famous manifesto, which had been refused by all the printers in 
London, King James having issued a proclamation threatening with severest 
punishment all who should circulate or even dare to read it. For this daring 
act White was sent prisoner to Hull Castle, where he was confined until the 
town surrendered. He was afterwards rewarded by William III with the 
appointment of " Their Majesties Printer for the City of York and the five 
Northern Counties ", dated May 26th, 1689. In 17 14 he was elected one of the 
City Chamberlains. He died January loth, 1 7 j |, aged 80, and was buried in the 
church of St. Michael le Belfrey. He was twice married ; his son by his first wife 
was the John White (q, v.) who became a printer and bookseller at Newcastle- 
upon-Tyne. His second wife Grace survived him and carried on the busi- 
ness until her death in 1 7 2 1 . Thomas Gent, who afterwards carried on White's 
business at York, was in 1714-15 a workman under him. [Davies, pp. 131.] 
WHITE (JOHN), junior, printer in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, (i) in the Close, i7o8(?) 
-II ; (2) on the Side, 1712-69 ; and in York, in Stonegate, near St. Helen's 
Church, 1725-35. i7o8(?)-69. Son of John White, senior; born about 1689. 
In 1708, according to Davies, and in any case by 1711, he set up by himself the 
second permanent press at Newcastle. In 1 7 1 1 he began to print The Newcastle 
Courant{no. i, August), per haps a continuation of The Newcastle Gazette, orThe 
NorthernCourani,vfhichSa.ywe\l had printed for Button, and which disappears

about this time. His output consisted, besides the usual local sermons and 
pamphlets, in chap-books and ballads, of which he was a large producer ; 
one of these. The Second Part of Jack and the Giant, is dated 171 1. [b.m. 1076. 
1. 18 (23).] Woodcuts soon became a feature of his books, and he printed two 
handsome works of local interest, Henry Bourne's Antiquitates Vulgares, 1725, 
and History of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 1736. In 1739 White found presses 
and pressmen to print off the Sallust, and Scougal's Life of God in the Soul of 
Man from the stereotype plates made by Ged {q. v.), which had been refused 
by other printers. White apparently disliked his niece Alice Bourne's marriage 
with Gent, by which she took his father's York business out of the family, 
and was on bad terms with Gent, who calls him " our unmerciful uncle ". 
In 1725, the year following the marriage, whether or not, as Gent supposed, 
out of animosity, he set up a rival press in York, with the aid of one Robert 
Ward, who was probably its practical manager. They printed a newspaper. 
The York Courant (no. i calculated to be for August or September 1725), and 
some books. In September 1734 White was elected sheriff of the city of York ; 
but in 1735 he sold his business to Alexander Staples. He continued to print 
at Newcastle ; in 1761 he took a partner, and in 1769 he died, in his eighty- 
first year, " the oldest master printer in England ". [Welford, pp. 18-23 > 
Davies, pp. 233-6, &c. ; Nichols, III. 688 ; Gent, pp. 160-3.] 

WHITE (LAWRENCE), bookseller in London, White Cross Street, 1679. His 
name is found in the imprint to a broadside on the Popish Plot in 1679. 
[Haz. II. 486.] 

WHITE (MARGARET), bookseller in London, 1683. She published in 1683 
Crossing of Proverbs, by B. R., Gent. [Pepys ; Haz. I. 477.] 

WHITE (ROBERT), printer in London, 1639-77. See Dictionary, 1641-67. He 
was still at work in 1677. 

WHITLEDGE (Robert), printer, bookseller, and bookbinder in London, 
(i) Bible in Creed Lane within Ludgate ; (2) Bible and Ball in Ave Mary Lane. 
c. 1695 (?)~i7^3- A publisher of Welsh books. In The Post Man of January 
25th, 17 1 1, he advertised The Welsh Common Fold at Bristol Fair. Dunton 
[p. 250] tells us that he was a printer and in partnership with Everingham, and 
that the pair "loved themselves into two Journeymen printers again". 
Perhaps he had by 1711 set up afresh as a bookseller. He contributed to the 
Bowyer fund in 17 13. 



WHITLOCK— WHITWORTH. 311 

WHITLOCK (ELIZABETH), bookseller in London, near Stationers' Hall, 1695-9. 
Doubtless widow of John Whitlock. Her name first appears in the Term 
Catalogues in Hil. 1696. [T.C. 11. 567.] She published several theological 
pamphlets and A Compleat List oj the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses oj the 
New Parliament, 1698. [b.m. 1850. c. 6 (16).] 

WHITLOCK (JOHN), bookseller in London, near Stationers' Hall, 1683-95. 
His name first appears in the Term Catalogue for Mich. 1683. [T.C. 11. 39.] 
In 1684 he advertised a novel, The Grand Vizier [T.C. 11. 96], and then he 
disappears from the Catalogue for ten years. In 1694 he reappears as selling 
TJu Parish Clerk's Vade Mecum. [T.C. 11. 520.] In 1695 he issued Solon 
Secundus : or, some defects in the English Laws [b.m. 8122. aaa. 20 (15)], 
and in the same year An exact Journal oj the victorious Expedition of the Con- 
federate Fleet . . . under . . . Admiral Russell. [T.C. II. 557.] Whitlock appears 
to have died shortly after this, and he was succeeded by Elizabeth Whitlock, 
presumably his widow. 

WHITWOOD (WILLIAM), bookseller in London, (i) Swan, Duck Lane ; (2) 
Golden Lion, Duck Lane, next Smithfield ; (3) Golden Bell, Duck Lane ; (4) 
Middle Exchange, Strand ; (5) next the Cross Keys, Strand, near Ivy Bridge ; 
(6) next the George Inn, Little Britain ; (7) Angel and Bible, near the George 
Inn, Little Britain ; (8) next to the Bible, Duck Lane ; (9) Golden Dragon, 
next door to the Crown Tavern, Duck Lane, near West Smithfield ; (10) Rose 
and Crown, Little Britain. 1666-99. This bookseller, who started 
business in 1666 and was therefore only briefly noticed in the Dictionary, 
1641-67 {q. v.), was chiefly remarkable for the number of times in which he 
changed his place of business. He was at the Golden Bell in 1676, and in 
1680 had moved into the Strand, where he published Richard Izacke's 
Remarkable Antiquities of the City of Exeter. [T.C. 1. 419.] In 1682 he was back 
in Little Britain, and his last entry in the Term Catalogues shows that between 
1697 and 1699 he once more altered his sign to the Rose and Crown. He was 
a miscellaneous and prolific publisher and used the Term Catalogues freely. 
Dunton [p. 292] calls him " rolling and honest Whitwood ", a phrase which 
may imply that he was a " rolling printer ", i.e. a printer of engravings, but 
which may merely allude to his constant removals, though some of his addresses 
given above probably refer to the same house. 

WHITWORTH (JOHN), bookseller in Manchester, Smithy Door, 1697 (?)-i 727. 
Successor to Zachary Whitworth. According to the inscription on the family 



312 VVHITWORTH— WIDDOWES, 

gravestone at Cross Street Chapel, John Whitworth died August 2nd, 1727, 
aged sixty-four. [R. W. Procter, Memorials of Manchester Streets, p. 183.] 
His son Robert, bom in July 1707, was the printer of The Manchester Magazine, 
and eventually became a bankrupt. 

WHITWORTH (zachary), bookseller in Manchester, Smithy Door, 1690-7. 
In the Poll Book of 1690 Zachary is accredited to the amount of one shilling. 
On November 30th, 1697, he was buried. He was succeeded by John 
Whitworth. [R. W. Procter, Memorials of Manchester Streets, p. 183.] 

WIAT. 5««WyaL 

WICKER (TOBIAS), stationer in London, 1683. In Hil. 34-5 Chas. II (1682-3)

WICKINS (JOHN), bookseller in London, (1) White Hart, Fleet Street, over 
against St. Dunstan's Church, 1679-84 ; (2) Mitre, Fleet Street, 1684-95 (•'*)• 
1679-95. Began to publish in 1679, when he issued a translation of 
Mervault's History of the Siege of Rochel. [T.C. I. 369.] In 1680, in company 
with T. Basset, he published William Petyt's Miscellanea Parliamentaria. 
[T.C. I. 421], and also, with Heyrick and Dring, A Collection of Letters, 
relating to the Popish Plot, and published by order of the House of 
Commons. [T.C. i. 425.] Hazlitt [iii. 189] records his imprint in 1695. 

WIDDOWES (GILES), bookseller in London, (i) Maiden's Head, Aldersgate 
Street, i66g ; (2) Green Dragon, St. Paul's Churchyard, 1670-5. 1669-75. 
His name first appears in the Term Catalogue for Mich. 1669, when, with 
Cademan of the Pope's Head, he pubhshed Frances Boothby's tragicomedy, 
Marcelia. Amongst his publications at this time was John Josselyn's New 
England's Rarities discovered . . . Illustrated with cuts, 1672 [T.C. I. 112], and 
the same author's Account of two Voyages to New England, 1674. Both these 
books contain lists of his publications. [T.C. I. 177.] Widdowes used as his 
device a dragon with the letters G. W. above it. His last book entry was 
made in Trin. 1675, and his death occurred soon afterwards. He was succeeded 
by his widow, Margaret Widdowes {q. v.). 

WIDDOWES (MARGARET), bookseller in London, Green Dragon, St. Paul's 
Churchyard, 1676-80 (?). Widow of Giles Widdowes ; her name appears for the 
first time in the Term Catalogue for Hil. 1676, and is met with up to Easter 
1679. The Complete Catalogue of all t/ie stitcht Books and single sheets printed 



WILCOX— WILDE. 313 

since the first discovery of the Popish Plot, 1680, was sold at the Green Dragon 
in St. Paul's Churchyard. [T.C. I. 228, 354, 386, 406, 419.] She encouraged 
Dunton, while still an apprentice, in his amour with Rachael Seaton. 

WILCOX (j.), bookseller in London, 1721-62 (?). He sold the sixth edition of 
N. Cox's GentletnatC s Recreation in 1721. Benjamin Franklin, while working 
in Palmer's office, lodged next door to Wilcox's shop, and was allowed, for a fee, 
to use the stock as a lending library. [Franklin, Autobiography, ed. J. Bigelow, 
1909, p. 91.] This bookseller may perhaps be identical with the John 
Wilcox, Gent., who in 1762 took part in a certain insurrectionary move- 
ment in the Company of Stationers. [Timperley, p. 709.]. 

WILDE (allington), printer in London, Aldersgate Street, 1722-31. Son of 
John Wilde. In 1722 he printed an edition of Mandeville for Conyers, Norris, 
and Bettesworth. He died in 1731. His daughter Martha was the first wife of 
Samuel Richardson. 

WILDE (jAMES), bookseller in Hereford, 17 14. Subscribed to Walker's 
Sufferings of the Clergy. 

WILDE (JOHN), printer in London. Aldersgate Street, 1693-1709. Samuel 
Richardson was bound apprentice to John Wilde in 1706. Dunton thus 
writes of him [p. 252] : " He has a very noble Printing House in Aldersgate 
Street. Whilst I employed him, he was always very civil and obliging! 
I brought him to be concerned in printing 'The Present State of Europe', in 
which he is yet employed." Wilde printed many almanacs for the Company 
of Stationers. He was succeeded by his son Allington Wilde. [Timperley.] 

WILDE (JOSEPH), bookseller in Dublin, Castle Street, 1672-83. In 1672 
Benjamin Tooke printed for him Dr. John Steam's De Obstinatione, edited by 
Henry Dodwell, Fellow of Trinity College. [T.C. I. 113.] In the same year 
he published Dudley Loftus's translation of Dionysius Syrus on St. Mark. 
[b.m. 3227. c. 13.]^ His imprint occurs on a few books for the next four years, 
and then again in 1682 and 1683. Perhaps related to Richard Wilde, of 
London and Dublin. 

WILDE, or WILD (JOSEPH), bookseller in London, Elephant (a) near, (b) at, 
Charing Cross, 1698-1700. He sold Daniel Baker's Poems upon Several 
Occasions, 1698, and Charles Hopkins's poem, The Art of Love, 1700. [r.C.IIl. 
55, 1 73-] 



314 WILDE— WILKIN. 

WILDE, or WILD (richard), printer, bookseller, and book-auctioneer in London 
and Dublin ; London, (i) Bible and Crown, Ludgate Hill, 1686-8 ; (2) Map 
of the World, St. Paul's Churchyard, 1689-90 (1696-7 ?); Dublin, 1694-5,1698. 
1686-98. First known as London publisher of Gramrnaiica Anglo-Rotnana, by 
Sam. Shaw of Ashby-de-la-Zouch ; Michael Johnson of Lichfield shared this 
publication with him. [T.C. ii. 180.] He dealt specially in anti-Quaker 
pamphlets. He did not use the Term Catalogues after 1690. \T.C. II. 331.] 
In 1694 and 1695 he appears as a printer at Dublin, printing in the latter year 
an Act of Parliament (6 W. & M. cap. 2), though not King's Printer. He was 
again in London between that year and 1698, when he followed Dunton to 
Dublin and conducted his auction there for him. Dunton gives, in the 
Dublin Scuffle, a long and laudatory account of Wilde, in the course of which 
he tells us that he was " descended from an antient family in Herefordshire, 
and brought up to Learning . . . was bound apprentice to George Sawbridge ", 
that he remained a bachelor, had met with losses but preserved his integrity, 
that he was a "great Williamite", and was therefore called in derision 
" Protestant Dick ". [Life and Errors, &c., pp. 550, 617-19, &c.] He was 
perhaps related to Joseph Wilde of Dublin. 

WILDE (w.), printer in London, 1687-96. A jobbing printer. He was probably 
the W. W. who, with one J. R., printed in 1687 an edition of Forde's Montelion 
for Thackeray and Passenger [Bodl. Douce D. 225], as in 1696 his full name 
is found on the imprints of the same author's Parismus [b.m. 12450. f. 5], and 
Deloney's Gentle Craft [Bodl. Douce D. 237], and also of the undated 
fourteenth edition of Deloney's Jack oj Newbury, printed for Passinger and 
Thackeray, [b.m. 1077. g. 35 (i).] 

WILFORD (JOHN), bookseller in London, Three Flower de Luces, Little 
Britain, 1722-32. Perhaps a descendant of George Wilford, bookseller in 
Little Britain in 1652 ; see Dictionary, 1641-67. Hazlitt mentions one or two 
books published by him between 1724 and 1727. He is mentioned in the will 
of Thomas Norris, the London Bridge bookseller, who died in 1732. [P.C.C. 
Bedford, 174.] 

WILKIN (RICHARD), bookseller in London, King's Head in St. Paul's Church- 
yard, 1693-1720. Referred to by Dunton [p. 234] as a " bookseller of good 
reputation ". He began to publish in 1693 [T.C. Ii. 475], and from that time 
until 1720 he published much, chiefly in theology. 



WILKIN S— WILKINSON; 315 

WILKINS (FRANCIS), printer in London, near Fleet Street, 1700. Only known 
from the imprint to a broadside, Aci anent the Aliment of poor prisoners 
• (October 9th, 1696, Scotland), 1700. [b.m. T. 100* (221).] 

WILKINS (JOHN), bookseller in London, (i) Maiden's Head, New Cheapside,in 
Moorfields, 1670 ; (2) Exchange Alley, by the Exchange Coffee House, over

WILKINS (JONATHAN), bookseller in London, Star in Cheapside, next Mercers 
Chappel, 1680-1703 (?). With Nathaniel Ponder and Samuel Lee he issued a 
broadside illustrating the mock procession of the Pope, &c., which paraded 
the streets of London on November 17th, 1680, in commemoration of the 
Fire of London, [b.m. C. 20. f. 6 (26).] He was also the publisher of other 
broadsides. He is perhaps the person referred to by Dunton [p. 292] as 
" Apprentice Wilkins (commonly called so from his being a good servant and a 
bad master)." 

WILKINS (MATTHEW), printer in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, 17 15 (?). [Allnutt, 
p. 299.] 

WILKINS (RICHARD), bookseller in Limerick, c. i66o-c. 1680. In 1686, being 
then fifty, he was Dunton's landlord at Boston, whither, the latter tells us, 
he had fled for conscience' sake. He is not included by Dunton in his list 
of the Boston booksellers, so he had apparently adopted some other trade. 
[Dunton, pp. 131, 136.] 

WILKINS (wn^LlAM), printer in London, Little Britain, 1 700-51 . The favourite 
printer of the Whig party. He printed The Whitehall Evening Post and 
several other London newspapers. Gent was employed by him for a time. 
[Davies, p. 148.] He died in 175 1, and bequeathed a portrait of Dr. Benjamin 
Hoadly to the Stationers' Company. [Timperley, p. 680.] 

WILKINSON (CHRISTOPHER), bookseller in London, Black-Boy in Fleet Street, 
1669-93. Began publishing with T. Basset in 1669, their first entry in the 
Term Catalogues being Peter Heylyn's Help to English History. [T.C. I. 24.] 
Wilkinson became one of the most important publishers in London, issuing 
books on all subjects. The last entry under his name was in Easter 1693. 



3i6 WILKINSON— WILLIAMS* 

He was succeeded by E. Wilkinson, probably his widow. [T.C. Ii. 458, 486.] 
Robert Newberry, Wilkinson's apprentice, being then about thirteen, ran away 
from him on January 2nd, i6|^, and was described in an advertisement ; he 
is not otherwise known. 
WILKINSON (e.), bookseller in London, Black Boy in Fleet Street, over 
against St. Dunstan's Church, 1693-6. Successor and probably widow of 
Christopher Wilkinson. Made a first book entry in the Term Catalogue for 
, Mich. 1693, and carried on the business until 1696, when it was taken over 
by Abel Roper, who had been a partner in the business for some time. 

WILKINSON (jAMES), bookseller and printer (?) at Portsmouth, near the 
[Point] Bridge, 1711-55. Publisher of J. Davis's Seaman's Speculum. 
[Post Man, March loth, it^Q- ; T.C. ill. 673.] In 1755 Archibald Maxwell's 
Portsmouth was "printed and sold by W. Horton, J. Wilkinson and R. Carr; 
but this may mean only that the book was sold by them. [F. A. Edwards, 
Early Hampshire Printers (Hampshire Field Club Papers, 1891), p. 126.] 

WILLIAMS (JOHN), senior, bookseller in London, (i) Crown, St. Paul's Church- 
yard, 1636-66 ; (2) Blue Anchor in Little Britain, 1667 ; (3) Crown, Cross 
Keys Court, Little Britain, 1670-6 ; (4) Crown, St. Paul's Churchyard, 
1676-83. 1636-83. See Dictionary, 1641-67. His later career can be traced in 
the Term Catalogues. [T.C. I. 27-406.] He died in i68§, for his will, to which 
Benjamin Tooke was one of the witnesses, was proved on March 14th. He 
was succeeded by his son John Williams, junior. 

WILLIAMS (JOHN), junior, bookseller in London, (i) Crown, Cross Keys Court, 
Little Britain, 1672-4 ; (2) Crown, St. Paul's Churchyard, 1684. 1672-84. 
Between 1672 and 1674 he published several books from the house in Little 
Britain at which his father was in business, but apparently on his own account. 
[T.C. I. 96, &c.] In 1684 his name, without the " junior ", is found as publish- 
ing at the house in St. Paul's Churchyard where his father had latterly 
published till his death in the previous year. Nothing is known of his career 
for the intervening decade. 

WILLIAMS (JOHN), bookseller in Ruthin, 1699. Sold school-books which he 
purchased of John Minshull, bookseller of Chester (q. v.). [Library, 2nd ser., 
IV. 373-83-] 

WILLIAMS (t.), printer at Oxford, 17 18. Printed a broadside on Edward 
Biss. [Bodl. Fol. e. 662 (9).] 



WILLIAMS— WILMOT. 3x7 

WILLIAMS (THOMAS), bookseller in London, (i) Bible, Little Britain, 1662-70 ; 
(2) Golden Ball, Hosier Lane, 1672-5 (-8 ?). 1662-78. See Dictionary, 1641-67. 
He continued to publish until 1678. His last and perhaps most substantial 
publication was Wilson and Bagwell's Complete Christian Dictionary, 1678. 
[T,C. I. 323.] In 1679 his assigns were Chiswell, Tooke, and Sawbridge. 
He married the daughter of Richard Cotes, printer ; his eldest son Thomas 
died in 167 1. [Smyth, Obituary, pp. 79-91.] 

WILLIAMS (W.), bookseller (?) in London, White Swan, Blackfriars, 1677. 
Published Poetical Piety, apparently his own composition. [T.C. I. 281-2.] 

WILLIAMSON (GAVIN), bookbinder in Edinburgh, 1681. Will registered 
December 27th, 1681. [Bann. Misc. II. 296 ; Aldis, p. 124.] 

WILLIAMSON (JOHN), bookseller in London, (i) Sun and Bible, or Bible, next 
the Golden Cock, on London Bridge, 1670-8 ; (2) Cannon Street, 1677. 
1670-78. Began to publish in 1670, when he issued Wingate's Arithmetic. 
[T.C. I. 60.] He was also the publisher of Hans Bloome's Description of ... , 
Architecture in 1674. [T.C. I. 166.] He was succeeded at the house on 
London Bridge by Stephen Foster in 1679. The Cannon Street address appears 
with the other on one imprint of 1677. [T.C. i. 279.] 

WILLIS (j.), bookseller in London, Three Crowns, Henrietta Street, Covent 
Garden, 1701. Published The Beau in a Wood, A Satyr. [T.C. in. 245.]

WILLSON (h.), bookseller in Boston, Lincolnshire, 1721. [W. C. B.'s list of 
provincial booksellers in N. & Q., loth ser., V. 141.] See Wilson (Henry). 

WILMER (THOMAS), printer in London, 1709. Printer of Richard Gibson's 
almanac, Astrologus Britannicus, 1709, for the Company of Stationers. He 
also printed in 17 14 for William Webb, bookseller in Chichester, a sermon by 
Matthew Woodford. [b.m. 225. h. 3 (15).] 

WILMOT ( ), printer in London, Fenchurch Street, 1724. Included by 
Negus among the " well-affected " printers. Possibly identical with William 
Wilmot, the Dublin printer. 

WILMOT (JOHN), senior and junior, booksellers and stationers in Oxford, in 
St, Mary's parish, near Lincoln College, 1637-17 18. See Dictionary, 1641-67. 



3i8 WILMOT— WILSON. 

This name is found in Oxford at intervals during this period. It must obviously 
describe two, and possibly three, generations. [Madan, pp. 29-31.] Wood 
frequently dealt at the shop, and in 1676 made notes for a catalogue from 
books bought by Wilmot of a Dr. Lockey. His references to Mr. John Wilmot 
cover the years 1659-81, [i. 295, IV. 9.] The name is found in the Term 
Catalogues in 1671 and 1705. [T.C. I. 79-80, III. 482.] Hearne's "Mr. Wilmot 
bookseller in Oxford " [vil. 257, &c.] probably means Samuel, who may have 
been another son of " old Mr. Wilmot ". [vil. 174.] 

WILMOT (SAMUEL), bookseller in Oxford and in London (?), i7i5(?)-33. 
Hearne has many references to this bookseller. In one of these he notes 
the prices (some excessive) which Wilmot was asking for secondhand books. 
[Hearne, v., &c.] Possibly identical with the Samuel Wilmot who published 
some sermons in London in 1729. 

WILMOT (WILLIAM), printer in Dublin, 1724-7. He printed in 1724 two books, 
two pamphlets against Wood's halfpence, an almanac, and other pieces, and 
in 1727 Whalley's Advice from the Stars,8ic. He died intestate in this year. He 
may be the — Wilmot whom Negus mentions as printing in London in 1724. 

WILSON (GEORGE), printer in Wolverhampton, i724(?)-48. His name does 
not appear till 1744 ; but he may have been the anonymous printer of 
some tracts by Edward Elwall in 1724-6, and of advertisements in 
1734-6 of an annual Charity Sermon preached at Wolverhampton. He died 
in 1748, and was succeeded by his widow Mary Wilson, [Information kindly 
given by Mr. G. P. Mander.] 

WILSON (H.), printer in Maidstone. See Wilson (R.) 

WILSON (henry), bookseller in Boston, Lincolnshire, 17 19. A Strange and 
Wonderfull Account of ... a Fiery Meteor . . . seen at . . . Boston was printed 
at Stamford for him. [Bodl. Arch. Bodl. A. 11, 152, 35.] Presumably identical 
with H. Willson, 1721. 

WILSON (JOHN), bookbinder in Glasgow, 1696-1726. His name occurs as a 
subscriber of £100 to the Darien Company in the list published in 1696. 
[Aldis, p. 124.] John Wilson, bookbinder, is also mentioned in the Records 
of the Burgh of Glasgow under date February 14th, 1726. 

WILSON (r.), printer (?) and bookseller at Maidstone, 1701 (?)-7. Published 
the Life of James II, by F. Brettoneau, in 1704, and Gods Providence the 



WINDSOR— WOOD. 319 

support of Government, by J. Bernard, Vicar of Ospring in 1707. The 
"H. Wilson ", given by Cotton (2nd ser.) as a printer and bookseller at Maid- 
stone in 1701 is probably an error for this R. Wilson. 

WINDSOR (josiAH), printer in Dublin, 1667-9. He printed an Oratio for 
Peter Butler in 1667, and a poem in 1669. 

WINGFIELD (JOHN), bookseller in London, Crutched Friars, near the Church, 
1669-71. Publisher of nautical and mathematical books during these years. 
[T.C. I. 19, 80.] 

WINTER (JOHN), printer in London, 1668 (?)-72 (?). He was examined in 1668 
for printing Roman Catholic books ; and he was further prosecuted by the 
Company of Stationers for working as a printer without licence. His press was 
thereupon partly demolished. Upon the Queen's intercession it was after- 
wards returned to him, but in the list of printing houses of 1675 his business 
was said to have been " bought in by the Company since 1672 ". [S.P.D. 
Chas. II, 261 (37) ; Records of the Stationers' Company; Haz. i. 114, 11. 
581.] 

WINTER (WH-LIAM), bookseller in Dublin, 1682. One of those selling A Judge- 
ment of the Comet, 1682. 

WITHERS (SAMUEL), bookseller (?) at Coventry, Trinity Churchyard, 1694. In 
the London Gazette of May ioth-i4th, 1694, is the following advertisement : 
" In the City of Coventry at the House of Mr. Samuel Withers in or near 
Trinity Church Yard on Wednesday the 23rd Inst, will be sold by auction 
a Catalogue of English Books ... by Joseph Shelton. Catalogues may be had 
gratis at Bemford's Coffee House in Coventry, and at the place of sale." 
It seems probable that Samuel Withers was a Coventry bookseller. The 
auctioneer, Joseph Shelton, was a London bookseller. 

WOLLASTON (john), bookseller at Bishop's Castle, Salop, 1713. Only known 
from W. C. B.'s list of provincial booksellers. [N. & Q., loth ser., V. 141.] 

WOOD (thomas), printer in Oxford and in London, 1715-42. [Madan, p. 32.] 
The Oxford and London imprints with this name seem to refer to the same 
man. He is probably the T. W. who in 1720 printed in London for a number 
of booksellers the works of Machiavelli. [Esdaile, p. 264.] Negus enters him 
as " well-affected " ; and Nichols notes that he was the printer of the fifth 
volume of Thuanus' Historiae for Samuel Buckley in 1733. [Lit. Anecd. II. 26.] 
He was for a time in partnership with T. Sharpe. 



320 WOODEN— WOOLFE. 

WOODEN (JOHN), bookseller in Oxford, 1698. [Madan, p. 31.] 

WOOD FALL (henry), printer in London, without Temple Bar, 1724- . Men- 
tioned in Negus's list as " well-afifected ". Nichols adds this note : " This was 
the first, I believe, of a name which has now for almost a century been con- 
spicuous in the Annals of Typography. That the more immediate subject of 
this note was a man of wit and humour, is evident from the famous old ballad 
of Darby and Joan which he wrote when an apprentice to the printer of that 
name. At the age of forty he commenced master, at the suggestion, and under 
the auspices of Mr. Pope, who had distinguished his abilities as a scholar 
whilst a journeyman in the employment of the then printer to this admired 
author. Of his personal history I know little farther, except that he carried 
on a considerable business with reputation ; and had two sons, Henry, 
a printer in Paternoster Row, and George a bookseller at Charing Cross, 
both of whom I well remember ". [Lit. Anecd. i. 300.] Woodfall was 
apprentice to one John Darby : as he was forty by 1724, this must 
have been to the elder Darby, who died in 1704. 

WOODWARD ( ), bookbinder in London, c. 1680-^5 (?). Dunton [p. 262] 
tells us that he bound for him, and suggests that he specialized in binding 
folios ; he also says that Woodward was related to one Mitchel, a bookbinder 
of St. Christopher's Alley, probably J. Mitchell, of Threadneedle Street {q. v.). 
It may be noticed that James Woodward lived in St. Christopher's Alley 
rather later. 

WOODWARD (JAMES), bookseller in London, (i) (a) St. Christopher's Alley, 
Threadneedle Street, near St. Christopher's Church, {b) St. Christopher's 
Churchyard, behind the Royal Exchange, 1707-9 ; (2) Scalding Alley, near 
the Royal Exchange. 1707-23. First met with in Mich. 1707, when he 
advertised The Mathematical and Philosophical Works of John Wilkins, 
Bishop of Chester. [T.C. m. 571.] In 1708 he published Motteux's Rabelais. 
[T.C. III. 600.] He was still in business in 1723. [Nichols, Lit. Anecd., i. 256.J 

WOOLFE (NICHOLAS), bookseller in London, (a) end of Bread Street in Cheap- 
side, {b) next the Red Lion in Cheapside, 1676-8. In Easter 1676 he 
advertised Poems, by T. Duffet [T.C. I. 236], and in 1678 New Songs and 
Poems a la Mode, by P. W. [T.C. 1. 303.] His two addresses may well refer to 
the same house. 



WOTTON— WRIGHT. 3«i 

WOTTON (MATTHEW), bookseller in London, (i) Three Pigeons, Fleet Street, 
1687 ; (2) Three Daggers, Fleet Street, 1687-1725 (?). 1687-1725 (?). This 
well-known publisher is first met with in Hil. 1687, when, in company with 
George Conyers, he advertised Thomas York's Practical Treatise of Arith- 
tnetick. [T.C. II, 187.] From that time his output of books increased rapidly. 
He published law-books, histories, travels, and medical works, and also 
romances and chap-books, such as The History 0/ the Seven Wise Masters, 
Greene's Dorastus and Fawnia, and A Thousand Notable Things. A list of 
books printed for him is given at the end of Richard Willis's Sermon before 
the Lord Mayor, 1702. [Bodl. Sermons 21.] In most of his later publications 
he only held a share with Chiswell, Tooke, Sawbridge, Conyers, and others. 
Writing in 1703 Dunton [p, 210] spoke of Wotton as "a very courteous, 
obliging man. His trade lies much among the lawyers ... I hear he is a rising 
man ". He was still publishing in 1725, and was succeeded by his son Thomas, 

WRIGHT ( ), bookseller in Nantwich, 1699, Sold grammars and books of 

devotion which he bought wholesale from John MinshuU, bookseller of 
Chester (q. v.). [Library, 2nd ser,, iv. 373-83.] 

WRIGHT (JOHN), junior, bookseller in London, (i) King's Head, Old Bailey, 
-1667 (?) ; (2) next door to the Globe in Little Britain, 1667 ; (3) Globe in 
Little Britain, 1667-77 ; (4) Crown, Ludgate Hill, 1678-93, 1634-93. See 
Dictionary, 1641-67, He must surely also be identical with the J, Wright 
there given as publishing " next door to the Globe in Little Britain " in 1667. 
He succeeded his father in 1658, and carried on and increased a large business. 
It was mostly in ballad-stock and chap-books, in partnership with Coles, 
Vere, and others, and he therefore did not use the Term Catalogues much, but 
made a certain number of entries in them between 1669 and 1693. [T.C. i. 
23, II. 458.] In 1681 he was with Chiswell defendant in an action for debt. 
[C.P.R. Mich. 33 Chas. II, 2996, m, 260 r,] In the Parish Register of Leeds is 
recorded the death on March 6th, 167 1 of " Mary daughter of Mr. John Wright 
bookeseller in London ", which may refer either to his sister or daughter, 
[Thoresby Soc. Publ. X. 160.] 

WRIGHT (JOHN), bookseller in Chatham, 171 1. One of those selling J. Davis's 
Seaman's Speculum, 1711. [T.C. III. 672 ; Postman, March loth.]

formists. Dunton [p. 207] says of him : " Mr. Wiat, if Trim Tram have any

INDEX OF 
PLACES OTHER THAN LONDON 



INDEX OF PLACES OTHER THAN LONDON 



For the convenience of users of the Biblic^raphicaJ Society's Dictionaries 
I have included in this index the names of all the provincial printers and 
booksellers given in Mr. Plomer's Dictionary , 1641-1667, except such as were 
already included in the index to the earlier Dictionary,! $57-1640. The index 
of the latter and the present one taken together should therefore, so far as 
the provinces are concerned, cover the whole period from 1557 to 1725. 
The few men who traded in the provinces before the earUer date may con- 
veniently be found in Mr. Gordon Duff's English Provincial Printers . . to 1557, 
Cambridge, 1912. Names occurring in the 1641-1667 Dictionary alone, 
or in the present work merely as cross-references, have been distinguished 
by an asterisk. The few persons mentioned, for various reasons, in the 
two Dictionaries as trading abroad have been listed on page 342 ; but it 
must of course be understood that neither this Dictionary nor Mr. Plomer's 
earlier one is intended to include foreign printers or publishers of English 
books as such. 

For the sake of brevity many non-significant variations of spelling, such 
as "Clark or Clarke", have been ignored and only that form given which is 
placed first in the text. The dates are added merely for convenience of 
reference. When the period during which a man worked at a particular place 
is clear from the text I have given this as his date. Otherwise the date is 
that of bis total activity. I have omitted all query-marks as the index is not 
intended to be used apart from the text of the Dictionary.
